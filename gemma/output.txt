**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 643 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 649.

**Calculation:**

- Since the number of Deer equals the number of Wolf, let's assume both are x.
- The sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf is x + x = 2x.
- The number of Bear is 643 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf, so the number of Bear is 643 + 2x.
- Therefore, the number of Bear is 643 + 2x = 643 + 2(649) = 643 + 1298 = 1941.

**Answer: 1941**<eos>
Define Wolf as V; so V = 649. Define Deer as e; so e = V = 649. Define Bear as u; X = e + V = 649 + 649 = 1298; so u = 643 + X = 643 + 1298 = 1941. Answer: 1941.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the number of wolf.
- the number of bear equals 643 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 649.

**calculation:**

- since the number of deer equals the number of wolf, let's assume both are x.
- the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf is x + x = 2x.
- the number of bear is 643 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf, so the number of bear is 643 + 2x.
- therefore, the number of bear is 643 + 2x = 643 + 2(649) = 643 + 1298 = 1941.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 525.
- The number of Parrot equals 375 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- Since the number of Owl equals the number of Eagle, let's assume both are x.
- The number of Eagle is 525, so x = 525.
- The number of Parrot is 375 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.
- Therefore, the number of Parrot is 375 + 2x = 375 + 2 * 525 = 375 + 1050 = 1425.

**Answer: 1425**<eos>
Define Eagle as b; so b = 525. Define Owl as a; so a = b = 525. Define Parrot as e; v = a + b = 525 + 525 = 1050; so e = 375 + v = 375 + 1050 = 1425. Answer: 1425.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 525.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 470.
- The number of Parrot equals 668 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- Since the number of Owl equals the number of Eagle, let's assume both are x.
- The number of Eagle is 470, so x = 470.
- The number of Parrot is 668 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.
- Therefore, the number of Parrot is 668 + 2x = 668 + 2 * 470 = 668 + 940 = 1608.

**Answer: 1608**<eos>
Define Eagle as y; so y = 470. Define Owl as K; so K = y = 470. Define Parrot as m; x = K + y = 470 + 470 = 940; so m = 668 + x = 668 + 940 = 1608. Answer: 1608.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 470.
- the number of parrot equals 668 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of eagle.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 207.
- The number of Parrot equals 530 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- Since the number of Owl equals the number of Eagle, let's assume both are x.
- The number of Eagle is 207, so x = 207.
- The number of Parrot is 530 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.
- Therefore, the number of Parrot is 530 + 2x = 530 + 2 * 207 = 530 + 414 = 944.

**Answer: 944**<eos>
Define Eagle as Z; so Z = 207. Define Owl as y; so y = Z = 207. Define Parrot as H; Y = y + Z = 207 + 207 = 414; so H = 530 + Y = 530 + 414 = 944. Answer: 944.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 207.
- the number of parrot equals 530 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- since the number of owl equals the number of eagle, let's assume both are x.
- the number of eagle is 207, so x = 207.
- the number of parrot is 530 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of eagle.
- therefore, the number of parrot is 530 + 2x = 530 + 2 * 207 = 530 + 414 = 944.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 122 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 280.

**Calculation:**

- Since the number of Deer equals the number of Wolf, let's assume both are x.
- The number of Bear is 122 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf, which can be written as:
Number of Bear = 122 + x + x = 122 + 2x.
- We know the number of Wolf equals 280, so we can write:
x = 280.
- Substituting the value of x, we get:
Number of Bear = 122 + 2(280) = 122 + 560 = 682.

**Answer: 682**<eos>
Define Wolf as G; so G = 280. Define Deer as Y; so Y = G = 280. Define Bear as E; z = Y + G = 280 + 280 = 560; so E = 122 + z = 122 + 560 = 682. Answer: 682.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the number of wolf.
- the number of bear equals 122 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 280.

**calculation:**

- since the number of deer equals the number of wolf, let's assume both are x.
- the number of bear is 122 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf, which can be written as:
number of bear = 122 + x + x = 122 + 2x.
- we know the number of wolf equals 280, so we can write:
x = 280.
- substituting the value of x, we get:
number of bear = 122 + 2(280) = 122 + 560 = 682.

- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 992 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 521.

**Calculation:**

- From the first statement, we know that the number of Owl equals the number of Parrot.
- From the third statement, we can write:

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 568 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 633.
- The number of Parrot equals 198 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- Since the number of Blue Jay equals the number of Eagle, let's assume x as the number of Blue Jay and Eagle.
- The number of Owl is 568 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle, so the number of Owl is:
Number of Owl = 568 + x
- The number of Eagle is 633, so we can write:
x = 633
- Substituting the value of x, we get:
Number of Owl = 568 + 633 = 1101

**Answer: 1101**<eos>
Define Eagle as N; so N = 633. Define Blue Jay as V; so V = N = 633. Define Owl as l; r = V + N = 633 + 633 = 1266; so l = 568 + r = 568 + 1266 = 1834. Answer: 1834.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay equals the number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals 568 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 633.
- the number of parrot equals 198 plus the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- since the number of blue jay equals the number of eagle, let's assume x as the number of blue jay and eagle.
- the number of owl is 568 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of eagle, so the number of owl is:
number of owl = 568 + x
- the number of eagle is 633, so we can write:
x = 633
- substituting the value of x, we get:
number of owl = 568 + 633 = 1101

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 71.
- The number of Fox equals 415 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Raccoon equals 440.
- The number of Bear equals 740 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals the number of Raccoon.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Bear as follows:
Number of Bear = 740 + (Number of Deer + Number of Raccoon)
- Since the number of Deer equals the number of Raccoon, we can substitute Number of Raccoon for Number of Deer:
Number of Bear = 740 + (Number of Raccoon + Number of Raccoon)
- Combining like terms, we get:
Number of Bear = 740 + 2 * Number of Raccoon
- The number of Raccoon is 440, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
Number of Bear = 740 + 2 * 440
- Multiplying, we get:
Number of Bear = 740 + 880
- Adding, we get:
Number of Bear = 1620

**Answer: 1620**<eos>
Define Raccoon as s; so s = 440. Define Deer as f; so f = s = 440. Define Bear as I; D = f + s = 440 + 440 = 880; so I = 740 + D = 740 + 880 = 1620. Answer: 1620.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 71.
- the number of fox equals 415 plus the number of bear.
- the number of raccoon equals 440.
- the number of bear equals 740 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of raccoon.
- the number of deer equals the number of raccoon.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of bear as follows:
number of bear = 740 + (number of deer + number of raccoon)
- since the number of deer equals the number of raccoon, we can substitute number of raccoon for number of deer:
number of bear = 740 + (number of raccoon + number of raccoon)
- combining like terms, we get:
number of bear = 740 + 2 * number of raccoon
- the number of raccoon is 440, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
number of bear = 740 + 2 * 440
- multiplying, we get:
number of bear = 740 + 880
- adding, we get:
number of bear = 1620

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 521 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 815.

**Calculation:**

- Since the number of Deer equals the number of Bear, let's assume both are x.
- The number of Wolf is 521 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Bear, which can be written as:
Number of Wolf = 521 + x + x = 521 + 2x.
- We know the number of Bear is 815, so we can set the above equation equal to 815 and solve for x:
521 + 2x = 815
2x = 294
x = 147.
- Therefore, the number of Deer and Bear is 147.
- The number of Wolf is 521 + 2x = 521 + 2(147) = 521 + 294 = 815.

**Answer: 815**<eos>
Define Bear as X; so X = 815. Define Deer as U; so U = X = 815. Define Wolf as d; L = U + X = 815 + 815 = 1630; so d = 521 + L = 521 + 1630 = 2151. Answer: 2151.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals 521 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 815.

**calculation:**

- since the number of deer equals the number of bear, let's assume both are x.
- the number of wolf is 521 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of bear, which can be written as:
number of wolf = 521 + x + x = 521 + 2x.
- we know the number of bear is 815, so we can set the above equation equal to 815 and solve for x:
521 + 2x = 815
2x = 294
x = 147.
- therefore, the number of deer and bear is 147.
- the number of wolf is 521 + 2x = 521 + 2(147) = 521 + 294 = 815.

Define Wolf as W; so W = 829. Define Deer as g; so g = W = 829. Define Fox as K; H = g + W = 829 + 829 = 1658; so K = 791 + H = 791 + 1658 = 2449. Answer: 2449.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 829.
- the number of bear equals 71.
- the number of fox equals 791 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- since the number of deer equals the number of wolf, let's assume both are x.
- the number of fox equals 791 + x + x = 791 + 2x.
- therefore, the number of fox is 791 + 2 * 829 = 791 + 1658 = 2449.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle is 949.
- The number of Parrot equals 993 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 106 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Owl is 106 plus the number of Eagle, so the number of Owl is 106 + 949 = 1055.
- The sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle is the number of Parrot minus the number of Eagle, so the number of Parrot is 1055 + 949 = 1904.

**Answer: 1904**<eos>
Define Eagle as v; so v = 949. Define Owl as s; j = v = 949; so s = 106 + j = 106 + 949 = 1055. Define Parrot as t; a = s + v = 1055 + 949 = 2004; so t = 993 + a = 993 + 2004 = 2997. Answer: 2997.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle is 949.
- the number of parrot equals 993 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals 106 plus the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- the number of owl is 106 plus the number of eagle, so the number of owl is 106 + 949 = 1055.
- the sum of the number of owl and the number of eagle is the number of parrot minus the number of eagle, so the number of parrot is 1055 + 949 = 1904.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 76 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 418 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 608.

**Calculation:**

1. From the equation "The number of Bear equals 418 plus the number of Wolf", we can get the number of Wolf:
Number of Wolf = Number of Bear - 418
Number of Wolf = 608 - 418
Number of Wolf = 190

2. From the equation "The number of Deer equals 76 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Wolf", we can get the number of Deer:
Number of Deer = 76 + (Number of Bear + Number of Wolf)
Number of Deer = 76 + (418 + 190)
Number of Deer = 76 + 608
**Answer: 684**<eos>
Define Wolf as S; so S = 608. Define Bear as s; t = S = 608; so s = 418 + t = 418 + 608 = 1026. Define Deer as R; C = s + S = 1026 + 608 = 1634; so R = 76 + C = 76 + 1634 = 1710. Answer: 1710.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals 76 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of wolf.
- the number of bear equals 418 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 608.

**calculation:**

1. from the equation "the number of bear equals 418 plus the number of wolf", we can get the number of wolf:
number of wolf = number of bear - 418
number of wolf = 608 - 418
number of wolf = 190

2. from the equation "the number of deer equals 76 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of wolf", we can get the number of deer:
number of deer = 76 + (number of bear + number of wolf)
number of deer = 76 + (418 + 190)
number of deer = 76 + 608

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 505 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 668 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 379.
- The number of Bear equals 792 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Raccoon as:
Number of Raccoon = Number of Bear + Number of Wolf + Number of Deer
- We can also calculate the number of Wolf as:
Number of Wolf = 668 + Number of Fox
- And the number of Deer as:
Number of Deer = 505 + Number of Wolf + Number of Fox
- Substituting the value of Number of Wolf from the second equation into the third equation, we get:
Number of Deer = 505 + (668 + Number of Fox) + Number of Fox
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
Number of Deer = 505 + 668 + 2 * Number of Fox
- Substituting the value of Number of Fox from the fourth equation, we get:
Number of Deer = 505 + 668 + 2 * 379
- Calculating the result, we get:
Number of Deer = 505 + 668 + 758 = 1531

**Answer: 1531**<eos>
Define Fox as q; so q = 379. Define Wolf as M; v = q = 379; so M = 668 + v = 668 + 379 = 1047. Define Deer as e; c = M + q = 1047 + 379 = 1426; so e = 505 + c = 505 + 1426 = 1931. Answer: 1931.
**arguments:**

- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of bear, the number of wolf, and the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 505 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of fox.
- the number of wolf equals 668 plus the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 379.
- the number of bear equals 792 plus the sum of the number of raccoon and the number of fox.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of raccoon as:
number of raccoon = number of bear + number of wolf + number of deer
- we can also calculate the number of wolf as:
number of wolf = 668 + number of fox
- and the number of deer as:
number of deer = 505 + number of wolf + number of fox
- substituting the value of number of wolf from the second equation into the third equation, we get:
number of deer = 505 + (668 + number of fox) + number of fox
- simplifying the equation, we get:
number of deer = 505 + 668 + 2 * number of fox
- substituting the value of number of fox from the fourth equation, we get:
number of deer = 505 + 668 + 2 * 379
- calculating the result, we get:
number of deer = 505 + 668 + 758 = 1531

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 813 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 734.
- The number of Deer equals 295 plus the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- From the third equation, we can solve for the number of Bear:
Number of Bear = Number of Deer - 295
- Substitute the value of Number of Bear from the above equation into the second equation:
734 = Number of Deer - (Number of Deer - 295)
- Solve for Number of Deer:
Number of Deer = 734 + (Number of Deer - 295)
Number of Deer = 1029
- Substitute the value of Number of Deer into the first equation:
Number of Wolf = 813 + 1029 + 734
**Answer: Number of Wolf = 2576**<eos>
Define Bear as V; so V = 734. Define Deer as H; s = V = 734; so H = 295 + s = 295 + 734 = 1029. Define Wolf as R; c = H + V = 1029 + 734 = 1763; so R = 813 + c = 813 + 1763 = 2576. Answer: 2576.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 813 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 734.
- the number of deer equals 295 plus the number of bear.

**calculation:**

- from the third equation, we can solve for the number of bear:
number of bear = number of deer - 295
- substitute the value of number of bear from the above equation into the second equation:
734 = number of deer - (number of deer - 295)
- solve for number of deer:
number of deer = 734 + (number of deer - 295)
number of deer = 1029
- substitute the value of number of deer into the first equation:
number of wolf = 813 + 1029 + 734
**answer: number of wolf = 2576**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 700 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 833 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 458.
- The number of Bear equals 875.

**Calculation:**

- From the equation: The number of Fox equals 700 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf, we can calculate the number of Fox as:
Number of Fox = 700 + (Number of Deer + Number of Wolf)
- From the equation: The number of Deer equals 833 plus the number of Wolf, we can calculate the number of Deer as:
Number of Deer = 833 + Number of Wolf
- Substitute the equation for the number of Deer into the equation for the number of Fox:
Number of Fox = 700 + (833 + Number of Wolf + Number of Wolf)
- Combine like terms:
Number of Fox = 700 + 833 + 2 * Number of Wolf
- We are given that the number of Wolf equals 458, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
Number of Fox = 700 + 833 + 2 * 458
- Calculate the number of Fox:
Number of Fox = 700 + 833 + 916
**Answer: 2459**<eos>
Define Wolf as r; so r = 458. Define Deer as p; t = r = 458; so p = 833 + t = 833 + 458 = 1291. Define Fox as c; G = p + r = 1291 + 458 = 1749; so c = 700 + G = 700 + 1749 = 2449. Answer: 2449.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals 700 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf.
- the number of deer equals 833 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 458.
- the number of bear equals 875.

**calculation:**

- from the equation: the number of fox equals 700 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf, we can calculate the number of fox as:
number of fox = 700 + (number of deer + number of wolf)
- from the equation: the number of deer equals 833 plus the number of wolf, we can calculate the number of deer as:
number of deer = 833 + number of wolf
- substitute the equation for the number of deer into the equation for the number of fox:
number of fox = 700 + (833 + number of wolf + number of wolf)
- combine like terms:
number of fox = 700 + 833 + 2 * number of wolf
- we are given that the number of wolf equals 458, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
number of fox = 700 + 833 + 2 * 458
- calculate the number of fox:
number of fox = 700 + 833 + 916

- The number of Eagle equals 747 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 356 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 674.

**Calculation:**

1. From the equation "The number of Parrot equals 356 plus the number of Owl", we can calculate the number of Parrot:
Number of Parrot = 356 + Number of Owl = 356 + 674 = 1030
2. From the equation "The number of Eagle equals 747 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl", we can calculate the number of Eagle:
Number of Eagle = 747 + (Number of Parrot + Number of Owl) = 747 + (1030 + 674) = 2451

**Answer: 2451**<eos>
Define Owl as t; so t = 674. Define Parrot as D; R = t = 674; so D = 356 + R = 356 + 674 = 1030. Define Eagle as r; k = D + t = 1030 + 674 = 1704; so r = 747 + k = 747 + 1704 = 2451. Answer: 2451.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 747 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of owl.
- the number of parrot equals 356 plus the number of owl.
- the number of owl equals 674.

**calculation:**

1. from the equation "the number of parrot equals 356 plus the number of owl", we can calculate the number of parrot:
number of parrot = 356 + number of owl = 356 + 674 = 1030
2. from the equation "the number of eagle equals 747 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of owl", we can calculate the number of eagle:
number of eagle = 747 + (number of parrot + number of owl) = 747 + (1030 + 674) = 2451

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 543 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 122 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 256 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 881.

**Calculation:**

- From the third equation, we can solve for the number of Fox:
Number of Fox = Number of Bear - 256
- From the first equation, we can solve for the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer:
Sum of Wolf and Deer = Number of Fox - 543
- From the second equation, we can solve for the number of Deer:
Number of Deer = Number of Wolf - 122
- Substituting the expression for Number of Wolf from the second equation into the first equation, we get:
Number of Fox = (Number of Deer - 122) - 543
- Substituting the value of Number of Deer from the third equation into the above equation, we get:
Number of Fox = (881 - 122) - 543
- Calculating the result:
Number of Fox = 216

**Answer: 216**<eos>
Define Deer as w; so w = 881. Define Wolf as E; K = w = 881; so E = 122 + K = 122 + 881 = 1003. Define Fox as U; c = E + w = 1003 + 881 = 1884; so U = 543 + c = 543 + 1884 = 2427. Answer: 2427.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals 543 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of deer.
- the number of wolf equals 122 plus the number of deer.
- the number of bear equals 256 plus the number of fox.
- the number of deer equals 881.

**calculation:**

- from the third equation, we can solve for the number of fox:
number of fox = number of bear - 256
- from the first equation, we can solve for the sum of the number of wolf and the number of deer:
sum of wolf and deer = number of fox - 543
- from the second equation, we can solve for the number of deer:
number of deer = number of wolf - 122
- substituting the expression for number of wolf from the second equation into the first equation, we get:
number of fox = (number of deer - 122) - 543
- substituting the value of number of deer from the third equation into the above equation, we get:
number of fox = (881 - 122) - 543
- calculating the result:
number of fox = 216

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 978 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 878 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 908.
- The number of Eagle equals 841.

**Calculation:**

1. From the equation "The number of Parrot equals 878 plus the number of Eagle", we can get the number of Eagle:
Number of Eagle = Number of Parrot - 878
Number of Eagle = 878 - 841
Number of Eagle = 37

2. From the equation "The number of Owl equals 978 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle", we can get the number of Owl:
Number of Owl = 978 + (Number of Parrot + Number of Eagle)
Number of Owl = 978 + (878 + 37)
Number of Owl = 978 + 915
**Answer: 1893**<eos>
Define Eagle as v; so v = 841. Define Parrot as I; g = v = 841; so I = 878 + g = 878 + 841 = 1719. Define Owl as m; j = I + v = 1719 + 841 = 2560; so m = 978 + j = 978 + 2560 = 3538. Answer: 3538.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals 978 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of eagle.
- the number of parrot equals 878 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of blue jay equals 908.
- the number of eagle equals 841.

**calculation:**

1. from the equation "the number of parrot equals 878 plus the number of eagle", we can get the number of eagle:
number of eagle = number of parrot - 878
number of eagle = 878 - 841
number of eagle = 37

2. from the equation "the number of owl equals 978 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of eagle", we can get the number of owl:
number of owl = 978 + (number of parrot + number of eagle)
number of owl = 978 + (878 + 37)
number of owl = 978 + 915

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 688 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 711 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 532.

**Calculation:**

1. From the equation "The number of Deer equals 711 plus the number of Bear", we can get the number of Bear:
Number of Bear = Number of Deer - 711
Number of Bear = 711 - 532
Number of Bear = 179

2. From the equation "The number of Wolf equals 688 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Bear", we can get the number of Wolf:
Number of Wolf = 688 + (Number of Deer + Number of Bear)
Number of Wolf = 688 + (711 + 179)
Number of Wolf = 688 + 890
**Answer: 1578**<eos>
Define Bear as j; so j = 532. Define Deer as p; Z = j = 532; so p = 711 + Z = 711 + 532 = 1243. Define Wolf as N; R = p + j = 1243 + 532 = 1775; so N = 688 + R = 688 + 1775 = 2463. Answer: 2463.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 688 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of bear.
- the number of deer equals 711 plus the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 532.

**calculation:**

1. from the equation "the number of deer equals 711 plus the number of bear", we can get the number of bear:
number of bear = number of deer - 711
number of bear = 711 - 532
number of bear = 179

2. from the equation "the number of wolf equals 688 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of bear", we can get the number of wolf:
number of wolf = 688 + (number of deer + number of bear)
number of wolf = 688 + (711 + 179)
number of wolf = 688 + 890

- The number of Eagle equals 562 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 513.

**Calculation:**

From the given information, we can deduce the following equations:

Blue Jay = 854 + Eagle
Parrot = 727 + Owl
Eagle = 562 + Parrot + Owl
Owl = 513

Substituting the value of Owl from the last equation into the others, we get:

Blue Jay = 854 + Eagle
Parrot = 727 + 513
Eagle = 562 + Parrot + 513

Solving for Eagle:

Eagle = 562 + Parrot + 513
Eagle = 562 + (727 + 513)
Eagle = 562 + 1240
**Answer: Eagle = 1702**<eos>
Define Owl as H; so H = 513. Define Parrot as e; U = H = 513; so e = 727 + U = 727 + 513 = 1240. Define Eagle as I; M = e + H = 1240 + 513 = 1753; so I = 562 + M = 562 + 1753 = 2315. Answer: 2315.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay equals 854 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of parrot equals 727 plus the number of owl.
- the number of eagle equals 562 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of owl.
- the number of owl equals 513.

**calculation:**

from the given information, we can deduce the following equations:

blue jay = 854 + eagle
parrot = 727 + owl
eagle = 562 + parrot + owl
owl = 513

substituting the value of owl from the last equation into the others, we get:

blue jay = 854 + eagle
parrot = 727 + 513
eagle = 562 + parrot + 513

solving for eagle:

eagle = 562 + parrot + 513
eagle = 562 + (727 + 513)
eagle = 562 + 1240
**answer: eagle = 1702**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 101 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 279 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 506.

**Calculation:**

1. From the equation "The number of Deer equals 279 plus the number of Bear", we can get the number of Bear:
Number of Bear = Number of Deer - 279
Number of Bear = 279
2. From the equation "The number of Wolf equals 101 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Bear", we can get the number of Wolf:
Number of Wolf = 101 + (Number of Deer + Number of Bear)
Number of Wolf = 101 + (279 + 506)
Number of Wolf = 101 + 785
**Answer: 886**<eos>
Define Bear as q; so q = 506. Define Deer as M; I = q = 506; so M = 279 + I = 279 + 506 = 785. Define Wolf as B; l = M + q = 785 + 506 = 1291; so B = 101 + l = 101 + 1291 = 1392. Answer: 1392.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 101 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of bear.
- the number of deer equals 279 plus the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 506.

**calculation:**

1. from the equation "the number of deer equals 279 plus the number of bear", we can get the number of bear:
number of bear = number of deer - 279
number of bear = 279
2. from the equation "the number of wolf equals 101 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of bear", we can get the number of wolf:
number of wolf = 101 + (number of deer + number of bear)
number of wolf = 101 + (279 + 506)
number of wolf = 101 + 785

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 653 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 972.
- The number of Owl equals 542 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the third equation, we can get the number of Eagle:
Number of Eagle = Number of Owl - 542
- Substitute the value of Number of Eagle from the second equation:
Number of Eagle = 972
- Therefore, Number of Owl = 972 - 542 = 430
- Substitute the value of Number of Owl into the third equation:
Number of Owl = 542 + 430 = 972
- From the first equation, we can get the number of Parrot:
Number of Parrot = 653 + Number of Owl + Number of Eagle
- Substitute the values of Number of Owl and Number of Eagle:
Number of Parrot = 653 + 972 + 430 = 2055

**Answer: 2055**<eos>
Define Eagle as D; so D = 972. Define Owl as c; Z = D = 972; so c = 542 + Z = 542 + 972 = 1514. Define Parrot as e; A = c + D = 1514 + 972 = 2486; so e = 653 + A = 653 + 2486 = 3139. Answer: 3139.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 653 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 972.
- the number of owl equals 542 plus the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- from the third equation, we can get the number of eagle:
number of eagle = number of owl - 542
- substitute the value of number of eagle from the second equation:
number of eagle = 972
- therefore, number of owl = 972 - 542 = 430
- substitute the value of number of owl into the third equation:
number of owl = 542 + 430 = 972
- from the first equation, we can get the number of parrot:
number of parrot = 653 + number of owl + number of eagle
- substitute the values of number of owl and number of eagle:
number of parrot = 653 + 972 + 430 = 2055

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 406 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 410 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 95.

**Calculation:**

1. From the equation "The number of Owl equals 410 plus the number of Parrot", we can get the number of Parrot:
Number of Parrot = Number of Owl - 410
Number of Parrot = 410 - 410
Number of Parrot = 0
2. From the equation "The number of Eagle equals 406 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Parrot", we can get the number of Eagle:
Number of Eagle = 406 + (Number of Owl + Number of Parrot)
Number of Eagle = 406 + (410 + 0)
Number of Eagle = 406 + 410
**Answer: 816**<eos>
Define Parrot as y; so y = 95. Define Owl as l; g = y = 95; so l = 410 + g = 410 + 95 = 505. Define Eagle as T; r = l + y = 505 + 95 = 600; so T = 406 + r = 406 + 600 = 1006. Answer: 1006.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 406 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals 410 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 95.

**calculation:**

1. from the equation "the number of owl equals 410 plus the number of parrot", we can get the number of parrot:
number of parrot = number of owl - 410
number of parrot = 410 - 410
number of parrot = 0
2. from the equation "the number of eagle equals 406 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of parrot", we can get the number of eagle:
number of eagle = 406 + (number of owl + number of parrot)
number of eagle = 406 + (410 + 0)
number of eagle = 406 + 410

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 462 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals 282 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 505.

**Calculation:**

1. From the equation "The number of Parrot equals 282 plus the number of Blue Jay", we can get the number of Blue Jay:
Number of Blue Jay = Number of Parrot - 282
Number of Blue Jay = 505 - 282
Number of Blue Jay = 223

2. From the equation "The number of Owl equals the number of Blue Jay", we can get the number of Owl:
Number of Owl = Number of Blue Jay
Number of Owl = 223

3. From the equation "The number of Eagle equals 462 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Blue Jay", we can get the number of Eagle:
Number of Eagle = 462 + (Number of Parrot + Number of Blue Jay)
Number of Eagle = 462 + (282 + 223)
Number of Eagle = 462 + 505
**Answer: 967**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as q; so q = 505. Define Parrot as u; p = q = 505; so u = 282 + p = 282 + 505 = 787. Define Eagle as F; W = u + q = 787 + 505 = 1292; so F = 462 + W = 462 + 1292 = 1754. Answer: 1754.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 462 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of blue jay.
- the number of parrot equals 282 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals 505.

**calculation:**

1. from the equation "the number of parrot equals 282 plus the number of blue jay", we can get the number of blue jay:
number of blue jay = number of parrot - 282
number of blue jay = 505 - 282
number of blue jay = 223

2. from the equation "the number of owl equals the number of blue jay", we can get the number of owl:
number of owl = number of blue jay
number of owl = 223

3. from the equation "the number of eagle equals 462 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of blue jay", we can get the number of eagle:
number of eagle = 462 + (number of parrot + number of blue jay)
number of eagle = 462 + (282 + 223)
number of eagle = 462 + 505

- The number of Eagle equals 129 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 167.
- The number of Owl equals 915 plus the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

1. From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl:
Number of Owl = 915 + Number of Parrot = 915 + 167 = 1082

2. From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle:
Number of Eagle = 129 + (Number of Owl + Number of Parrot) = 129 + (1082 + 167) = 129 + 1249 = 1378

**Answer: 1378**<eos>
Define Parrot as I; so I = 167. Define Owl as v; f = I = 167; so v = 915 + f = 915 + 167 = 1082. Define Eagle as x; r = v + I = 1082 + 167 = 1249; so x = 129 + r = 129 + 1249 = 1378. Answer: 1378.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 129 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 167.
- the number of owl equals 915 plus the number of parrot.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 316.
- The number of Owl equals 894.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 336 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 839 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay can be calculated as:
Number of Blue Jay = 336 + (Number of Parrot + Number of Eagle)
- The number of Parrot can be calculated as:
Number of Parrot = 839 + Number of Eagle
- The sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle can be calculated as:
Number of Parrot + Number of Eagle = (839 + Number of Eagle) + Number of Eagle = 2 * Number of Eagle + 839
- Substituting the above equation into the equation for the number of Blue Jay, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 336 + (2 * Number of Eagle + 839)
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 336 + 2 * Number of Eagle + 839
- Combining like terms, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 1175 + 2 * Number of Eagle

**Answer: Answer: 1175 + 2 * 316 = 1517**<eos>
Define Eagle as t; so t = 316. Define Parrot as U; z = t = 316; so U = 839 + z = 839 + 316 = 1155. Define Blue Jay as G; C = U + t = 1155 + 316 = 1471; so G = 336 + C = 336 + 1471 = 1807. Answer: 1807.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 316.
- the number of owl equals 894.
- the number of blue jay equals 336 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of eagle.

number of parrot = 839 + number of eagle
- the sum of the number of parrot and the number of eagle can be calculated as:
number of parrot + number of eagle = (839 + number of eagle) + number of eagle = 2 * number of eagle + 839
- substituting the above equation into the equation for the number of blue jay, we get:
number of blue jay = 336 + (2 * number of eagle + 839)
- simplifying the equation, we get:
number of blue jay = 336 + 2 * number of eagle + 839
- combining like terms, we get:
number of blue jay = 1175 + 2 * number of eagle

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 101 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 663 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 949.

**Calculation:**

- From the equation "The number of Deer equals 663 plus the number of Wolf", we can get the number of Wolf:
Number of Wolf = Number of Deer - 663
Number of Wolf = 663 + Number of Wolf - 663
Number of Wolf = Number of Wolf
- From the equation "The number of Bear equals 101 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf", we can get the number of Bear:
Number of Bear = 101 + Number of Deer + Number of Wolf
Number of Bear = 101 + (663 + Number of Wolf) + Number of Wolf
Number of Bear = 101 + 663 + 2 * Number of Wolf
Number of Bear = 764 + 2 * 949
Number of Bear = 764 + 1898
**Answer: 2662**<eos>
Define Wolf as G; so G = 949. Define Deer as Q; g = G = 949; so Q = 663 + g = 663 + 949 = 1612. Define Bear as C; k = Q + G = 1612 + 949 = 2561; so C = 101 + k = 101 + 2561 = 2662. Answer: 2662.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 101 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf.
- the number of deer equals 663 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 949.

**calculation:**

- from the equation "the number of deer equals 663 plus the number of wolf", we can get the number of wolf:
number of wolf = number of deer - 663
number of wolf = 663 + number of wolf - 663
number of wolf = number of wolf
- from the equation "the number of bear equals 101 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf", we can get the number of bear:
number of bear = 101 + number of deer + number of wolf
number of bear = 101 + (663 + number of wolf) + number of wolf
number of bear = 101 + 663 + 2 * number of wolf
number of bear = 764 + 2 * 949
number of bear = 764 + 1898

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 642 plus the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 274 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 346.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 783 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the equation for Owl, we can solve for the sum of the number of Parrot, Blue Jay, and Eagle:
  Owl = 642 + Parrot + Blue Jay + Eagle
  Parrot + Blue Jay + Eagle = Owl - 642
- From the equation for Parrot, we can solve for the sum of the number of Blue Jay and Eagle:
  Parrot = 274 + Blue Jay + Eagle
  Blue Jay + Eagle = Parrot - 274
- We can substitute the expression for Blue Jay + Eagle from the second equation into the first equation:
  Parrot + (Parrot - 274) = Owl - 642
  2 * Parrot = Owl - 642 + 274
  2 * Parrot = Owl - 368
  Parrot = (Owl - 368) / 2
- We can substitute the value of Owl from the first equation into the above equation to get:
  Parrot = (642 + Parrot + Blue Jay + Eagle - 368) / 2
  Parrot = (274 + Blue Jay + Eagle) / 2
- We can substitute the value of Eagle from the third equation into the above equation to get:
  Parrot = (274 + Blue Jay + 346) / 2
  Parrot = (620 + Blue Jay) / 2

**Answer: Parrot = 310 + Blue Jay / 2**<eos>
Define Eagle as L; so L = 346. Define Blue Jay as a; q = L = 346; so a = 783 + q = 783 + 346 = 1129. Define Parrot as M; R = a + L = 1129 + 346 = 1475; so M = 274 + R = 274 + 1475 = 1749. Answer: 1749.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals 642 plus the sum of the number of parrot, the number of blue jay, and the number of eagle.
- the number of parrot equals 274 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 346.
- the number of blue jay equals 783 plus the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- from the equation for owl, we can solve for the sum of the number of parrot, blue jay, and eagle:
  owl = 642 + parrot + blue jay + eagle
  parrot + blue jay + eagle = owl - 642
- from the equation for parrot, we can solve for the sum of the number of blue jay and eagle:
  parrot = 274 + blue jay + eagle
  blue jay + eagle = parrot - 274
- we can substitute the expression for blue jay + eagle from the second equation into the first equation:
  parrot + (parrot - 274) = owl - 642
  2 * parrot = owl - 642 + 274
  2 * parrot = owl - 368
  parrot = (owl - 368) / 2
- we can substitute the value of owl from the first equation into the above equation to get:
  parrot = (642 + parrot + blue jay + eagle - 368) / 2
  parrot = (274 + blue jay + eagle) / 2
- we can substitute the value of eagle from the third equation into the above equation to get:
  parrot = (274 + blue jay + 346) / 2
  parrot = (620 + blue jay) / 2

**answer: parrot = 310 + blue jay / 2**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 959 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 274 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 927 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 976.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Wolf = 959 + Number of Bear
- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Deer = 927 + Number of Wolf + Number of Bear
- Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get:
Number of Deer = 927 + (959 + Number of Bear) + Number of Bear
- Simplifying the equation, we have:
Number of Deer = 927 + 959 + 2 * Number of Bear
- Solving for Number of Deer, we get:
Number of Deer = 1935 + 2 * Number of Bear

**Answer: 1935 + 2 * Number of Bear**<eos>
Define Bear as a; so a = 976. Define Wolf as J; F = a = 976; so J = 959 + F = 959 + 976 = 1935. Define Deer as n; U = J + a = 1935 + 976 = 2911; so n = 927 + U = 927 + 2911 = 3838. Answer: 3838.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 959 plus the number of bear.
- the number of fox equals 274 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 927 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 976.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have:
number of wolf = 959 + number of bear
- from the third equation, we have:
number of deer = 927 + number of wolf + number of bear
- substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get:
number of deer = 927 + (959 + number of bear) + number of bear

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 378 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 380 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 705.

**Calculation:**

1. From the equation "The number of Deer equals 380 plus the number of Bear", we can get the number of Bear:
Number of Bear = Number of Deer - 380
Number of Bear = 380 + Number of Bear - 380
Number of Bear = Number of Bear

2. From the equation "The number of Wolf equals 378 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Bear", we can get the number of Wolf:
Number of Wolf = 378 + Number of Deer + Number of Bear
Number of Wolf = 378 + (380 + Number of Bear) + Number of Bear
Number of Wolf = 378 + 380 + 2 * Number of Bear
Number of Wolf = 758 + 2 * Number of Bear

3. From the equation "The number of Bear equals 705", we can get the number of Bear:
Number of Bear = 705

4. Substitute the number of Bear from step 3 into the equation from step 2 to get the number of Wolf:
Number of Wolf = 758 + 2 * 705
Number of Wolf = 758 + 1410
**Answer: 2168**<eos>
Define Bear as w; so w = 705. Define Deer as M; y = w = 705; so M = 380 + y = 380 + 705 = 1085. Define Wolf as A; G = M + w = 1085 + 705 = 1790; so A = 378 + G = 378 + 1790 = 2168. Answer: 2168.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 378 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of bear.
- the number of deer equals 380 plus the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 705.

**calculation:**

1. from the equation "the number of deer equals 380 plus the number of bear", we can get the number of bear:
number of bear = number of deer - 380
number of bear = 380 + number of bear - 380
number of bear = number of bear

2. from the equation "the number of wolf equals 378 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of bear", we can get the number of wolf:
number of wolf = 378 + number of deer + number of bear
number of wolf = 378 + (380 + number of bear) + number of bear
number of wolf = 378 + 380 + 2 * number of bear
number of wolf = 758 + 2 * number of bear

3. from the equation "the number of bear equals 705", we can get the number of bear:
number of bear = 705

4. substitute the number of bear from step 3 into the equation from step 2 to get the number of wolf:
number of wolf = 758 + 2 * 705
number of wolf = 758 + 1410

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 370 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 625 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 678.

**Calculation:**

1. From the equation "The number of Wolf equals 625 plus the number of Deer", we can calculate the number of Wolf:
Number of Wolf = 625 + Number of Deer = 625 + 678 = 1303.

2. From the equation "The number of Bear equals 370 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer", we can calculate the number of Bear:
Number of Bear = 370 + (Number of Wolf + Number of Deer) = 370 + (1303 + 678) = 2259.

**Answer: 2259**<eos>
Define Deer as z; so z = 678. Define Wolf as A; R = z = 678; so A = 625 + R = 625 + 678 = 1303. Define Bear as s; t = A + z = 1303 + 678 = 1981; so s = 370 + t = 370 + 1981 = 2351. Answer: 2351.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 370 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of deer.
- the number of wolf equals 625 plus the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 678.

**calculation:**

1. from the equation "the number of wolf equals 625 plus the number of deer", we can calculate the number of wolf:
number of wolf = 625 + number of deer = 625 + 678 = 1303.

2. from the equation "the number of bear equals 370 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of deer", we can calculate the number of bear:
number of bear = 370 + (number of wolf + number of deer) = 370 + (1303 + 678) = 2259.

Define Deer as Y; so Y = 466. Define Bear as P; b = Y = 466; so P = 358 + b = 358 + 466 = 824. Define Wolf as q; so q = P = 824. Define Fox as F; t = q + Y = 824 + 466 = 1290; so F = 58 + t = 58 + 1290 = 1348. Answer: 1348.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 358 plus the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 466.
- the number of wolf equals the number of bear.
- the number of fox equals 58 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of deer.

**calculation:**

- the number of bear is 358 + 466 = 824.
- the number of wolf is 824 (because the number of wolf equals the number of bear).
- the sum of the number of wolf and the number of deer is 824 + 466 = 1290.
- the number of fox is 58 + 1290 = 1348.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Parrot, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 353.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 111 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 111 + (number of Owl) + (number of Parrot) = 111 + number of Owl + 353.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Parrot, and the number of Owl = (111 + number of Owl + 353) + 353 + number of Owl.
- Therefore, the number of Eagle equals 111 + 2 * number of Owl + 353 + number of Owl = 464 + 3 * number of Owl.

**Answer: 464 + 3 * number of Owl**<eos>
Define Parrot as X; so X = 353. Define Owl as y; so y = X = 353. Define Blue Jay as C; V = y + X = 353 + 353 = 706; so C = 111 + V = 111 + 706 = 817. Define Eagle as K; e = C + X = 817 + 353 = 1170; so K = e + y = 1170 + 353 = 1523. Answer: 1523.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of parrot, and the number of owl.
- the number of parrot equals 353.
- the number of blue jay equals 111 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals the number of parrot.

**calculation:**

- the number of blue jay equals 111 + (number of owl) + (number of parrot) = 111 + number of owl + 353.
- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of parrot, and the number of owl = (111 + number of owl + 353) + 353 + number of owl.
- therefore, the number of eagle equals 111 + 2 * number of owl + 353 + number of owl = 464 + 3 * number of owl.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 541 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 281 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 203.

**Calculation:**

- From the first statement, we know that the number of Bear equals the number of Fox, which we can denote as x.
- From the third statement, we can write an equation:
Number of Wolf = 281 + x
- From the second statement, we can write an equation:
Number of Deer = 541 + x + Number of Wolf
- Substituting the expression for Number of Wolf from the third statement into the equation for Number of Deer, we get:
Number of Deer = 541 + x + (281 + x)
- Combining like terms, we get:
Number of Deer = 822 + 2x
- Since the number of Bear equals the number of Fox, we can write:
x = Number of Bear = Number of Fox
- Substituting this value of x into the equation for Number of Deer, we get:
Number of Deer = 822 + 2(203)
- Calculating, we get:
Number of Deer = 822 + 406
**Answer: 1228**<eos>
Define Fox as q; so q = 203. Define Bear as P; so P = q = 203. Define Wolf as H; U = P + q = 203 + 203 = 406; so H = 281 + U = 281 + 406 = 687. Define Deer as b; E = H + P = 687 + 203 = 890; so b = 541 + E = 541 + 890 = 1431. Answer: 1431.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals the number of fox.
- the number of deer equals 541 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals 281 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 203.

**calculation:**

- from the first statement, we know that the number of bear equals the number of fox, which we can denote as x.
- from the third statement, we can write an equation:
number of wolf = 281 + x
- from the second statement, we can write an equation:
number of deer = 541 + x + number of wolf
- substituting the expression for number of wolf from the third statement into the equation for number of deer, we get:
number of deer = 541 + x + (281 + x)
- combining like terms, we get:
number of deer = 822 + 2x
- since the number of bear equals the number of fox, we can write:
x = number of bear = number of fox
- substituting this value of x into the equation for number of deer, we get:
number of deer = 822 + 2(203)
- calculating, we get:
number of deer = 822 + 406

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 102 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 990 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 999.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Wolf = Number of Deer + Number of Fox
- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Fox = 990
- Substituting the third equation into the first equation, we get:
Number of Wolf = Number of Deer + 990
- From the second equation, we have:
Number of Bear = 102 + (Number of Wolf + Number of Fox)
- Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
Number of Bear = 102 + (Number of Deer + 990 + Number of Fox)
- Substituting the third equation into the above equation, we get:
Number of Bear = 102 + (990 + 999)
- Calculating the final answer:
Number of Bear = 102 + 1989
**Answer: 2091**<eos>
Define Fox as j; so j = 999. Define Deer as B; v = j = 999; so B = 990 + v = 990 + 999 = 1989. Define Wolf as e; so e = B + j = 1989 + 999 = 2988. Define Bear as t; R = e + j = 2988 + 999 = 3987; so t = 102 + R = 102 + 3987 = 4089. Answer: 4089.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of deer and the number of fox.
- the number of bear equals 102 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of fox.
- the number of deer equals 990 plus the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 999.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have:
number of wolf = number of deer + number of fox
- from the third equation, we have:
number of fox = 990
- substituting the third equation into the first equation, we get:
number of wolf = number of deer + 990
- from the second equation, we have:
number of bear = 102 + (number of wolf + number of fox)
- substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
number of bear = 102 + (number of deer + 990 + number of fox)
- substituting the third equation into the above equation, we get:
number of bear = 102 + (990 + 999)
- calculating the final answer:

- The number of Bear equals 257 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 558.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Fox = 28 + Number of Bear + Number of Wolf
- From the second equation, we have:
Number of Bear = 257 + Number of Wolf
- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Wolf = 558
- Substituting the expressions for Number of Bear and Number of Wolf from the second and third equations into the first equation, we get:
Number of Fox = 28 + (257 + Number of Wolf) + 558
- Simplifying, we get:
Number of Fox = 28 + 257 + Number of Wolf + 558
- Combining like terms, we get:
Number of Fox = 843 + Number of Wolf
- From the last equation, we have:
Number of Deer = Number of Fox + Number of Wolf
- Substituting the expression for Number of Fox from the previous step, we get:
Number of Deer = (843 + Number of Wolf) + Number of Wolf
- Simplifying, we get:
Number of Deer = 843 + 2 * Number of Wolf
- Substituting the value of Number of Wolf from the third equation, we get:
Number of Deer = 843 + 2 * 558
- Calculating, we get:
Number of Deer = 843 + 1116
**Answer: 1959**<eos>
Define Wolf as L; so L = 558. Define Bear as w; P = L = 558; so w = 257 + P = 257 + 558 = 815. Define Fox as x; c = w + L = 815 + 558 = 1373; so x = 28 + c = 28 + 1373 = 1401. Define Deer as K; so K = x + L = 1401 + 558 = 1959. Answer: 1959.

- The number of Bear equals 262 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon equals 554 plus the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Deer = number of Wolf + number of Fox + number of Bear
- The number of Bear = 262 + number of Fox = 262 + 912 = 1174
- The number of Deer = number of Wolf + 912 + 1174
- The number of Wolf = number of Bear + number of Fox = 1174 + 912 = 2086
- The number of Deer = 2086 + 912 + 1174 = 4172

**Answer: 4172**<eos>
Define Fox as q; so q = 912. Define Bear as R; G = q = 912; so R = 262 + G = 262 + 912 = 1174. Define Wolf as E; so E = R + q = 1174 + 912 = 2086. Define Deer as C; t = E + q = 2086 + 912 = 2998; so C = t + R = 2998 + 1174 = 4172. Answer: 4172.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 654 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 567 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 152.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Owl = 654 + (number of Blue Jay + number of Eagle)
- The number of Parrot = number of Owl = 654 + (number of Blue Jay + number of Eagle)
- The number of Blue Jay = 567 + number of Eagle
- Substituting the number of Eagle into the equation for the number of Blue Jay, we get:
  The number of Blue Jay = 567 + 152 = 719
- Substituting the number of Blue Jay into the equation for the number of Owl, we get:
  The number of Owl = 654 + 719 + 152 = 1525
- The number of Parrot = number of Owl = 1525

**Answer: 1525**<eos>
Define Eagle as u; so u = 152. Define Blue Jay as W; S = u = 152; so W = 567 + S = 567 + 152 = 719. Define Owl as c; q = W + u = 719 + 152 = 871; so c = 654 + q = 654 + 871 = 1525. Define Parrot as H; so H = c = 1525. Answer: 1525.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals 654 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of eagle.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 998.
- The number of Deer equals 830 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 83 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- From the first premise, we know that the number of Bear equals the number of Fox. Let's denote this number as x.
- From the third premise, we have:
Number of Deer = 830 + x + x = 830 + 2x
- From the fourth premise, we have:
Number of Fox = 83 + 998 = 1081
- Since the number of Bear equals the number of Fox, we have:
Number of Bear = x = Number of Fox - 83 = 1081 - 83 = 1008
- Substituting the value of x, we get:
Number of Deer = 830 + 2 * 1008 = 830 + 2016 = 2856

**Answer: 2856**<eos>
Define Wolf as X; so X = 998. Define Fox as m; y = X = 998; so m = 83 + y = 83 + 998 = 1081. Define Bear as D; so D = m = 1081. Define Deer as T; R = D + m = 1081 + 1081 = 2162; so T = 830 + R = 830 + 2162 = 2992. Answer: 2992.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals the number of fox.
- the number of wolf equals 998.
- the number of deer equals 830 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 83 plus the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- from the first premise, we know that the number of bear equals the number of fox. let's denote this number as x.
- from the third premise, we have:
number of deer = 830 + x + x = 830 + 2x
- from the fourth premise, we have:
number of fox = 83 + 998 = 1081
- since the number of bear equals the number of fox, we have:
number of bear = x = number of fox - 83 = 1081 - 83 = 1008
- substituting the value of x, we get:
number of deer = 830 + 2 * 1008 = 830 + 2016 = 2856

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 935.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 745 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 165 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the first premise, we know that the number of Eagle equals the number of Parrot, which we can denote as x.
- From the second premise, we know that the number of Parrot equals 935, so x = 935.
- From the third premise, we know that the number of Blue Jay equals 745 plus the number of Owl, so we can write:
Number of Blue Jay = 745 + Owl
- From the fourth premise, we know that the number of Owl equals 165 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Parrot, so we can write:
Number of Owl = 165 + x + 935
- Substituting the value of x from the second premise, we get:
Number of Owl = 165 + 935 + 935
- Therefore, the number of Owl is 2035.
- Substituting the value of Owl from the previous step, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 745 + 2035
- Therefore, the number of Blue Jay is 2780.

**Answer: 2780**<eos>
Define Parrot as o; so o = 935. Define Eagle as W; so W = o = 935. Define Owl as g; T = W + o = 935 + 935 = 1870; so g = 165 + T = 165 + 1870 = 2035. Define Blue Jay as r; A = g = 2035; so r = 745 + A = 745 + 2035 = 2780. Answer: 2780.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 935.
- the number of blue jay equals 745 plus the number of owl.
- the number of owl equals 165 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of parrot.

**calculation:**

- from the first premise, we know that the number of eagle equals the number of parrot, which we can denote as x.
- from the second premise, we know that the number of parrot equals 935, so x = 935.
- from the third premise, we know that the number of blue jay equals 745 plus the number of owl, so we can write:
number of blue jay = 745 + owl
- from the fourth premise, we know that the number of owl equals 165 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of parrot, so we can write:
number of owl = 165 + x + 935
- substituting the value of x from the second premise, we get:
number of owl = 165 + 935 + 935
- therefore, the number of owl is 2035.
- substituting the value of owl from the previous step, we get:
number of blue jay = 745 + 2035
- therefore, the number of blue jay is 2780.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 686 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 586.
- The number of Owl equals 473.
- The number of Crow equals 903 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- Since the number of Eagle equals the number of Parrot, let's assume both are x.
- From the equation "The number of Blue Jay equals 686 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Parrot", we have:
Number of Blue Jay = 686 + x + x = 686 + 2x
- From the equation "The number of Parrot equals 586", we have:
x = 586
- Therefore, the number of Eagle and Parrot is 586.
- From the equation "The number of Crow equals 903 plus the number of Blue Jay", we have:
Number of Crow = 903 + 2x = 903 + 2(586) = 903 + 1172 = 2075
**Answer: 2075**<eos>
Define Parrot as Q; so Q = 586. Define Eagle as j; so j = Q = 586. Define Blue Jay as e; K = j + Q = 586 + 586 = 1172; so e = 686 + K = 686 + 1172 = 1858. Define Crow as A; b = e = 1858; so A = 903 + b = 903 + 1858 = 2761. Answer: 2761.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 690 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals 34.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 18 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have the number of Parrot = 690 + Eagle.
- From the fourth equation, we have the number of Blue Jay = 18 + Parrot + Eagle.
- From the second and third equations, we have the number of Owl = Blue Jay = 18 + Parrot + Eagle.
- Substituting the first equation into the fourth equation, we get:
  18 + (690 + Eagle) + Eagle = 18 + Parrot + Eagle
  Therefore, Parrot = 690.
- Substituting the value of Parrot into the first equation, we get:
  690 + Eagle = Eagle
  Therefore, Eagle = 690.
- Substituting the value of Eagle into the second equation, we get:
  Owl = Blue Jay = 18 + 690 + 34 = 752.

**Answer: 752**<eos>
Define Eagle as k; so k = 34. Define Parrot as P; X = k = 34; so P = 690 + X = 690 + 34 = 724. Define Blue Jay as R; f = P + k = 724 + 34 = 758; so R = 18 + f = 18 + 758 = 776. Define Owl as q; so q = R = 776. Answer: 776.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 690 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals the number of blue jay.
- the number of eagle equals 34.
- the number of blue jay equals 18 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have the number of parrot = 690 + eagle.
- from the fourth equation, we have the number of blue jay = 18 + parrot + eagle.
- from the second and third equations, we have the number of owl = blue jay = 18 + parrot + eagle.
- substituting the first equation into the fourth equation, we get:
  18 + (690 + eagle) + eagle = 18 + parrot + eagle
  therefore, parrot = 690.
- substituting the value of parrot into the first equation, we get:
  690 + eagle = eagle
  therefore, eagle = 690.
- substituting the value of eagle into the second equation, we get:
  owl = blue jay = 18 + 690 + 34 = 752.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 135 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 207 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 749.
- The number of Deer equals the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- From the third equation, we know that the number of Wolf is 749.
- From the second equation, we can calculate the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf:

- The number of Bear equals 702.
- The number of Fox equals 629 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 527 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Wolf = Number of Bear = 702
- From the second equation, we have:
Number of Fox = 629 + (Number of Deer + Number of Wolf)
- Substituting the values we know, we get:
Number of Fox = 629 + (527 + 702)
- Simplifying, we get:
Number of Fox = 629 + 1229
**Answer: 1858**<eos>
Define Bear as M; so M = 702. Define Wolf as B; so B = M = 702. Define Deer as z; i = B + M = 702 + 702 = 1404; so z = 527 + i = 527 + 1404 = 1931. Define Fox as S; w = z + B = 1931 + 702 = 2633; so S = 629 + w = 629 + 2633 = 3262. Answer: 3262.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 702.
- the number of fox equals 629 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf.
- the number of deer equals 527 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals the number of bear.

**calculation:**

- from the third equation, we have:
number of wolf = number of bear = 702
- from the second equation, we have:
number of fox = 629 + (number of deer + number of wolf)
- substituting the values we know, we get:
number of fox = 629 + (527 + 702)
- simplifying, we get:
number of fox = 629 + 1229

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 871 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 389 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 918.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have the number of Eagle = 871 + Owl.
- From the second equation, we have the number of Parrot = 389 + 871 + Owl.
- From the third equation, we have the number of Blue Jay = Parrot.
- Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
  Parrot = 389 + 871 + Owl = 1260 + Owl.
- Substituting the above equation into the third equation, we get:
  Blue Jay = 1260 + Owl.
- Since the number of Owl is 918, we have:
  Blue Jay = 1260 + 918 = 2178.

**Answer: 2178**<eos>
Define Owl as M; so M = 918. Define Eagle as I; p = M = 918; so I = 871 + p = 871 + 918 = 1789. Define Parrot as A; i = I + M = 1789 + 918 = 2707; so A = 389 + i = 389 + 2707 = 3096. Define Blue Jay as e; so e = A = 3096. Answer: 3096.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 871 plus the number of owl.
- the number of parrot equals 389 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of owl.
- the number of blue jay equals the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals 918.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have the number of eagle = 871 + owl.
- from the second equation, we have the number of parrot = 389 + 871 + owl.
- from the third equation, we have the number of blue jay = parrot.
- substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
  parrot = 389 + 871 + owl = 1260 + owl.
- substituting the above equation into the third equation, we get:
  blue jay = 1260 + owl.
- since the number of owl is 918, we have:
  blue jay = 1260 + 918 = 2178.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 602 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 646 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 499.

**Calculation:**

- From the equation "The number of Eagle equals the number of Owl", we have the number of Eagle = 499.
- From the equation "The number of Blue Jay equals 646 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl", we have the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl = The number of Blue Jay - 646 = 646 - 646 = 0.
- From the equation "The number of Parrot equals 602 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle", we have the number of Parrot = 602 + 0 = 602.

**Answer: 602**<eos>
Define Owl as V; so V = 499. Define Eagle as M; so M = V = 499. Define Blue Jay as B; Q = M + V = 499 + 499 = 998; so B = 646 + Q = 646 + 998 = 1644. Define Parrot as U; y = B + M = 1644 + 499 = 2143; so U = 602 + y = 602 + 2143 = 2745. Answer: 2745.

- The number of Owl equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 441 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 375.
- The number of Eagle equals 552 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Parrot as:
Number of Parrot = 441 + (Number of Eagle + Number of Blue Jay)
- Since the number of Owl equals the number of Parrot, we have:
Number of Owl = Number of Parrot
- Substituting the above equation into the previous equation, we get:
Number of Owl = 441 + (Number of Eagle + 375)
- Simplifying the equation, we obtain:
Number of Owl = 816 + Number of Eagle

**Answer: 816 + Number of Eagle**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as B; so B = 375. Define Eagle as X; D = B = 375; so X = 552 + D = 552 + 375 = 927. Define Parrot as F; j = X + B = 927 + 375 = 1302; so F = 441 + j = 441 + 1302 = 1743. Define Owl as y; so y = F = 1743. Answer: 1743.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 441 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals 375.
- the number of eagle equals 552 plus the number of blue jay.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 167 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Deer, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 665.

**Calculation:**

- From the first premise, we know that the number of Fox equals the number of Bear. Let's call this number x.
- From the second premise, we know that the number of Bear equals 167 plus the number of Deer. So, x = 167 + 665 = 832.
- From the third premise, we know that the number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Deer, and the number of Bear. So, the number of Wolf is:
Number of Wolf = Fox + Deer + Bear
= x + 665 + x
= 832 + 665 + 832
= 2329

**Answer: 2329**<eos>
Define Deer as S; so S = 665. Define Bear as L; W = S = 665; so L = 167 + W = 167 + 665 = 832. Define Fox as n; so n = L = 832. Define Wolf as b; G = n + S = 832 + 665 = 1497; so b = G + L = 1497 + 832 = 2329. Answer: 2329.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 167 plus the number of deer.
- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of fox, the number of deer, and the number of bear.
- the number of deer equals 665.

**calculation:**

- from the first premise, we know that the number of fox equals the number of bear. let's call this number x.
- from the second premise, we know that the number of bear equals 167 plus the number of deer. so, x = 167 + 665 = 832.
- from the third premise, we know that the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of fox, the number of deer, and the number of bear. so, the number of wolf is:
number of wolf = fox + deer + bear
= x + 665 + x
= 832 + 665 + 832
= 2329

- The number of Wolf equals 540 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 672.
- The number of Deer equals 296 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Bear equals the number of Deer, so let's assume both are x.
- The number of Wolf equals 540 plus the number of Fox, so we can write: Number of Wolf = 540 + 672 = 1212.
- The number of Deer equals 296 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox, so we can write: Number of Deer = 296 + (Number of Wolf + Number of Fox) = 296 + (1212) = 1508.
- Therefore, the number of Bear is also 1508.

**Answer: 1508**<eos>
Define Fox as d; so d = 672. Define Wolf as h; b = d = 672; so h = 540 + b = 540 + 672 = 1212. Define Deer as j; E = h + d = 1212 + 672 = 1884; so j = 296 + E = 296 + 1884 = 2180. Define Bear as k; so k = j = 2180. Answer: 2180.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals the number of deer.
- the number of wolf equals 540 plus the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 672.
- the number of deer equals 296 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of fox.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we know that the number of bear equals the number of deer, so let's assume both are x.
- the number of wolf equals 540 plus the number of fox, so we can write: number of wolf = 540 + 672 = 1212.
- the number of deer equals 296 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of fox, so we can write: number of deer = 296 + (number of wolf + number of fox) = 296 + (1212) = 1508.
- therefore, the number of bear is also 1508.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question!

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 261 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 49.

**Calculation:**

- Since the number of Bear equals the number of Wolf, let's assume x as the number of Bear and Wolf.
- The number of Fox is 261 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Wolf, so it can be written as: Fox = 261 + x.
- The number of Deer is the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Bear, so it can be written as: Deer = Fox + Wolf + Bear = (261 + x) + 49 + x.
- Simplifying the equation, we get: Deer = 310 + 2x.

**Answer: Answer: 310 + 2x**<eos>
Define Wolf as P; so P = 49. Define Bear as u; so u = P = 49. Define Fox as A; L = u + P = 49 + 49 = 98; so A = 261 + L = 261 + 98 = 359. Define Deer as q; B = A + P = 359 + 49 = 408; so q = B + u = 408 + 49 = 457. Answer: 457.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals the number of wolf.
- the number of fox equals 261 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of wolf.
- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of fox, the number of wolf, and the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals 49.

**calculation:**

- since the number of bear equals the number of wolf, let's assume x as the number of bear and wolf.
- the number of fox is 261 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of wolf, so it can be written as: fox = 261 + x.
- the number of deer is the sum of the number of fox, the number of wolf, and the number of bear, so it can be written as: deer = fox + wolf + bear = (261 + x) + 49 + x.
- simplifying the equation, we get: deer = 310 + 2x.

**answer: answer: 310 + 2x**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 179 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 33 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 395.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Deer = Number of Fox + Number of Wolf
- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Fox = 33 + Number of Wolf
- Substituting the third equation into the first equation, we get:
Number of Deer = (33 + Number of Wolf) + Number of Wolf
- Simplifying, we have:
Number of Deer = 33 + 2 * Number of Wolf
- From the second equation, we have:
Number of Bear = 179 + Number of Deer + Number of Wolf
- Substituting the expression for Number of Deer from above, we get:
Number of Bear = 179 + (33 + 2 * Number of Wolf) + Number of Wolf
- Simplifying, we have:
Number of Bear = 212 + 3 * Number of Wolf

**Answer: Answer: 212 + 3 * 395 = 212 + 1185 = 1397**<eos>
Define Wolf as a; so a = 395. Define Fox as x; c = a = 395; so x = 33 + c = 33 + 395 = 428. Define Deer as U; so U = x + a = 428 + 395 = 823. Define Bear as g; N = U + a = 823 + 395 = 1218; so g = 179 + N = 179 + 1218 = 1397. Answer: 1397.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of fox and the number of wolf.
- the number of bear equals 179 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf.
- the number of fox equals 33 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 395.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have:
number of deer = number of fox + number of wolf
- from the third equation, we have:
number of fox = 33 + number of wolf
- substituting the third equation into the first equation, we get:
number of deer = (33 + number of wolf) + number of wolf
- simplifying, we have:
number of deer = 33 + 2 * number of wolf
- from the second equation, we have:
number of bear = 179 + number of deer + number of wolf
- substituting the expression for number of deer from above, we get:
number of bear = 179 + (33 + 2 * number of wolf) + number of wolf
- simplifying, we have:
number of bear = 212 + 3 * number of wolf

**answer: answer: 212 + 3 * 395 = 212 + 1185 = 1397**<eos>

Define Fox as d; so d = 48. Define Bear as p; so p = d = 48. Define Deer as q; P = p + d = 48 + 48 = 96; so q = 87 + P = 87 + 96 = 183. Define Wolf as u; K = q + p = 183 + 48 = 231; so u = 888 + K = 888 + 231 = 1119. Answer: 1119.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 888 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of bear.
- the number of deer equals 87 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 48.
- the number of bear equals the number of fox.

**calculation:**

- from the third statement, we know that the number of bear equals 48.
- from the second statement, we can calculate the sum of the number of bear and the number of fox:
  sum = bear + fox = 48 + 48 = 96
- from the first statement, we can calculate the number of wolf:
  wolf = 888 + sum = 888 + 96 = 984

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 196.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 306 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- From the first premise, we have the number of Wolf equals 196.
- From the second premise, we have the number of Deer equals 196.
- From the third premise, we have the number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer.
- From the fourth premise, we have the number of Bear equals 306 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.
- Substituting the values we know into the equation for the number of Fox, we get:
Number of Fox = 306 + (Number of Wolf + Number of Deer)
- Substituting the values we know for the number of Wolf and Deer, we get:
Number of Fox = 306 + (196 + 196)
- Adding the numbers together, we get:
Number of Fox = 306 + 392
**Answer: 698**<eos>
Define Deer as v; so v = 196. Define Wolf as Q; so Q = v = 196. Define Bear as G; K = Q + v = 196 + 196 = 392; so G = 306 + K = 306 + 392 = 698. Define Fox as r; n = G + Q = 698 + 196 = 894; so r = n + v = 894 + 196 = 1090. Answer: 1090.

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 575 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 475 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 341.

**Calculation:**

- From the equation: The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Deer, we have:
Number of Bear = Number of Fox + Number of Deer
- From the equation: The number of Deer equals 575 plus the number of Wolf, we have:
Number of Deer = 575 + Number of Wolf
- From the equation: The number of Fox equals 475 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf, we have:
Number of Fox = 475 + (575 + Number of Wolf)
- Substitute the equation for Number of Deer into the equation for Number of Fox:
Number of Fox = 475 + (575 + 341)
- Simplify:
Number of Fox = 475 + 916
- Calculate:
Number of Fox = 1391
- Substitute the value of Number of Fox into the equation for Number of Bear:
Number of Bear = 1391 + Number of Deer
- Substitute the equation for Number of Deer into the equation for Number of Bear:
Number of Bear = 1391 + (575 + 341)
- Simplify:
Number of Bear = 1391 + 916
- Calculate:
**Answer: Number of Bear = 2307**<eos>
Define Wolf as i; so i = 341. Define Deer as T; s = i = 341; so T = 575 + s = 575 + 341 = 916. Define Fox as Y; Q = T + i = 916 + 341 = 1257; so Y = 475 + Q = 475 + 1257 = 1732. Define Bear as N; so N = Y + T = 1732 + 916 = 2648. Answer: 2648.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 530 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals 290.
- The number of Parrot equals 148 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have: Number of Blue Jay = 530 + Number of Parrot
- From the third equation, we have: Number of Parrot = 148 + Sum of Owl and Eagle
- From the fourth equation, we have: Number of Owl = Number of Eagle
- Substituting the third and fourth equations into the first equation, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 530 + (148 + Number of Eagle)
- Simplifying, we have:
Number of Blue Jay = 530 + 148 + Number of Eagle
- Combining like terms, we have:
Number of Blue Jay = 678 + Number of Eagle

**Answer: 678 + Number of Eagle**<eos>
Define Eagle as o; so o = 290. Define Owl as X; so X = o = 290. Define Parrot as t; x = X + o = 290 + 290 = 580; so t = 148 + x = 148 + 580 = 728. Define Blue Jay as H; J = t = 728; so H = 530 + J = 530 + 728 = 1258. Answer: 1258.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 602.
- The number of Fox equals 773 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 826 plus the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Wolf = Number of Fox + Number of Deer
- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Fox = 773 + Number of Deer + Number of Bear
- From the fourth equation, we have:
Number of Deer = 826 + Number of Bear
- Substituting the third and fourth equations into the first equation, we get:
Number of Wolf = (773 + Number of Deer + Number of Bear) + Number of Deer
- Simplifying, we have:
Number of Wolf = 773 + 2 * Number of Deer + Number of Bear
- From the second equation, we have:
Number of Bear = 602
- Substituting this value into the previous equation, we get:
Number of Wolf = 773 + 2 * Number of Deer + 602
- Combining like terms, we have:
Number of Wolf = 1375 + 2 * Number of Deer

**Answer: Answer: 1375 + 2 * Number of Deer**<eos>
Define Bear as B; so B = 602. Define Deer as X; n = B = 602; so X = 826 + n = 826 + 602 = 1428. Define Fox as V; O = X + B = 1428 + 602 = 2030; so V = 773 + O = 773 + 2030 = 2803. Define Wolf as f; so f = V + X = 2803 + 1428 = 4231. Answer: 4231.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of fox and the number of deer.
- the number of bear equals 602.
- the number of fox equals 773 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of bear.
- the number of deer equals 826 plus the number of bear.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have:
number of wolf = number of fox + number of deer
- from the third equation, we have:
number of fox = 773 + number of deer + number of bear
- from the fourth equation, we have:
number of deer = 826 + number of bear
- substituting the third and fourth equations into the first equation, we get:
number of wolf = (773 + number of deer + number of bear) + number of deer
- simplifying, we have:
number of wolf = 773 + 2 * number of deer + number of bear
- from the second equation, we have:
number of bear = 602
- substituting this value into the previous equation, we get:
number of wolf = 773 + 2 * number of deer + 602
- combining like terms, we have:
number of wolf = 1375 + 2 * number of deer

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 4 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 432 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 566.

**Calculation:**

- From the first statement, we know that the number of Deer equals the number of Fox, which we can denote as x.
- From the third statement, we can write an equation:
Number of Bear = 432 + x
- From the second statement, we can write an equation:
Number of Wolf = 4 + (Number of Bear + Number of Fox)
- Substituting the equation for the number of Bear from above, we get:
Number of Wolf = 4 + (432 + x + 566)
- Simplifying, we get:
Number of Wolf = 4 + 998 + x
- Combining like terms, we get:
Number of Wolf = 1002 + x

**Answer: 1002 + x**<eos>
Define Fox as k; so k = 566. Define Deer as a; so a = k = 566. Define Bear as L; J = a + k = 566 + 566 = 1132; so L = 432 + J = 432 + 1132 = 1564. Define Wolf as j; u = L + k = 1564 + 566 = 2130; so j = 4 + u = 4 + 2130 = 2134. Answer: 2134.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the number of fox.
- the number of wolf equals 4 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of fox.
- the number of bear equals 432 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of fox.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 225 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 399 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 597.

**Calculation:**

- From the third equation, we can rewrite it as:
Number of Parrot = 399 + (Number of Blue Jay + Number of Owl)
- Substitute the value of Number of Owl from the last equation:
Number of Parrot = 399 + (225 + 597)
- Calculate:
Number of Parrot = 399 + 822 = 1211
- From the first equation:
Number of Eagle = Number of Parrot + Number of Blue Jay
- Substitute the values we calculated:
Number of Eagle = 1211 + 225
- Calculate:
**Answer: Number of Eagle = 1436**<eos>
Define Owl as V; so V = 597. Define Blue Jay as F; w = V = 597; so F = 225 + w = 225 + 597 = 822. Define Parrot as P; h = F + V = 822 + 597 = 1419; so P = 399 + h = 399 + 1419 = 1818. Define Eagle as m; so m = P + F = 1818 + 822 = 2640. Answer: 2640.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of parrot and the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals 225 plus the number of owl.

= Number of Wolf + 1135

- From the first equation, we can calculate the number of Fox as:
Number of Fox = 728 + Number of Deer
= 728 + (Number of Wolf + 1135)
= Number of Wolf + 1863

**Answer: Answer: 1863**<eos>
Define Bear as U; so U = 966. Define Wolf as v; so v = U = 966. Define Deer as T; H = v + U = 966 + 966 = 1932; so T = 169 + H = 169 + 1932 = 2101. Define Fox as i; d = T = 2101; so i = 728 + d = 728 + 2101 = 2829. Answer: 2829.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals 728 plus the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 169 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 966.
- the number of raccoon equals 466.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of deer as:
number of deer = 169 + (number of wolf + number of bear)
= 169 + (number of wolf + 966)
= 169 + number of wolf + 966
= number of wolf + 1135

- from the first equation, we can calculate the number of fox as:
number of fox = 728 + number of deer
= 728 + (number of wolf + 1135)
= number of wolf + 1863

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 955 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 325.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 781 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Wolf = 955 + Number of Deer + Number of Fox
- From the second equation, we have:
Number of Fox = 325
- From the fourth equation, we have:
Number of Deer = 781 + Number of Fox
- Substituting the second and fourth equations into the first equation, we get:
Number of Wolf = 955 + (781 + Number of Fox) + 325
- Combining like terms, we have:
Number of Wolf = 1661 + Number of Fox
- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Bear = Number of Wolf + Number of Deer
- Substituting the above equation for Number of Wolf, we get:
Number of Bear = (1661 + Number of Fox) + Number of Deer
- We know that Number of Deer = 781 + Number of Fox, so we can substitute:
Number of Bear = (1661 + Number of Fox) + (781 + Number of Fox)
- Combining like terms, we have:
Number of Bear = 2442 + 2 * Number of Fox

**Answer: 2442 + 2 * 325 = 2442 + 650 = 3092**<eos>
Define Fox as c; so c = 325. Define Deer as j; y = c = 325; so j = 781 + y = 781 + 325 = 1106. Define Wolf as d; m = j + c = 1106 + 325 = 1431; so d = 955 + m = 955 + 1431 = 2386. Define Bear as L; so L = d + j = 2386 + 1106 = 3492. Answer: 3492.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 955 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 325.
- the number of bear equals the sum of the number of wolf and the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 781 plus the number of fox.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have:
number of wolf = 955 + number of deer + number of fox
- from the second equation, we have:
number of fox = 325
- from the fourth equation, we have:
number of deer = 781 + number of fox
- substituting the second and fourth equations into the first equation, we get:
number of wolf = 955 + (781 + number of fox) + 325
- combining like terms, we have:
number of wolf = 1661 + number of fox
- from the third equation, we have:
number of bear = number of wolf + number of deer
- substituting the above equation for number of wolf, we get:
number of bear = (1661 + number of fox) + number of deer
- we know that number of deer = 781 + number of fox, so we can substitute:
number of bear = (1661 + number of fox) + (781 + number of fox)
- combining like terms, we have:
number of bear = 2442 + 2 * number of fox

**answer: 2442 + 2 * 325 = 2442 + 650 = 3092**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 369 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 73 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 777.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Blue Jay:
Number of Blue Jay = 73 + Number of Owl = 73 + 777 = 850
- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle:
Number of Eagle = 369 - Number of Blue Jay = 369 - 850 = -481 (This result is negative, which is not possible. Therefore, we assume that there are no Eagles in this location.)
- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Parrot:
Number of Parrot = Number of Eagle + Number of Blue Jay = 0 + 850 = 850

**Answer: 850**<eos>
Define Owl as W; so W = 777. Define Blue Jay as e; y = W = 777; so e = 73 + y = 73 + 777 = 850. Define Eagle as k; X = e + W = 850 + 777 = 1627; so k = 369 + X = 369 + 1627 = 1996. Define Parrot as M; so M = k + e = 1996 + 850 = 2846. Answer: 2846.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 369 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of owl.
- the number of blue jay equals 73 plus the number of owl.
- the number of parrot equals the sum of the number of eagle and the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals 777.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of blue jay:
number of blue jay = 73 + number of owl = 73 + 777 = 850
- from the given information, we can calculate the number of eagle:
number of eagle = 369 - number of blue jay = 369 - 850 = -481 (this result is negative, which is not possible. therefore, we assume that there are no eagles in this location.)
- from the given information, we can calculate the number of parrot:
number of parrot = number of eagle + number of blue jay = 0 + 850 = 850

- The number of Crow equals 998 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 820 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 274.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Crow, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

1. From the given information, we can calculate the number of Crow:
Crow = 998 + Owl + Blue Jay
Crow = 998 + 820 + 274
Crow = 2,092

2. We can also calculate the number of Owl:
Owl = 820 + Blue Jay
Owl = 820 + 274
Owl = 1,094

3. Using the relationship between Parrot and Crow, we can find the number of Parrot:
Parrot = Crow - Owl
Parrot = 2,092 - 1,094
Parrot = 998

**Answer: 998**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as A; so A = 274. Define Owl as Z; h = A = 274; so Z = 820 + h = 820 + 274 = 1094. Define Crow as H; f = Z + A = 1094 + 274 = 1368; so H = 998 + f = 998 + 1368 = 2366. Define Parrot as Q; so Q = H + Z = 2366 + 1094 = 3460. Answer: 3460.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 945 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 148 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 584.

**Calculation:**

1. From the equation "The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer.", we have:
Number of Wolf = Number of Bear + Number of Deer

2. From the equation "The number of Bear equals 945 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.", we have:
Number of Bear = 945 + Number of Deer + Number of Fox

3. From the equation "The number of Deer equals 148 plus the number of Fox.", we have:
Number of Deer = 148 + Number of Fox

4. Substitute the expressions for Number of Bear and Number of Deer from steps 2 and 3 into the equation from step 1:
Number of Wolf = (945 + Number of Deer + Number of Fox) + (148 + Number of Fox)

5. Combine like terms:
Number of Wolf = 1093 + 2 * Number of Fox

6. Substitute the value of Number of Fox from the given information:
Number of Wolf = 1093 + 2 * 584

7. Calculate the final answer:
Number of Wolf = 1093 + 1168 = 2261

**Answer: 2261**<eos>
Define Fox as W; so W = 584. Define Deer as X; u = W = 584; so X = 148 + u = 148 + 584 = 732. Define Bear as L; O = X + W = 732 + 584 = 1316; so L = 945 + O = 945 + 1316 = 2261. Define Wolf as t; so t = L + X = 2261 + 732 = 2993. Answer: 2993.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of bear and the number of deer.
- the number of bear equals 945 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of fox.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 568 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 733.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 569 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Parrot = Number of Owl + Number of Blue Jay
- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Eagle = 568 + Number of Parrot + Number of Owl
- Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
Number of Eagle = 568 + (Number of Owl + Number of Blue Jay) + Number of Owl
- Combining like terms, we have:
Number of Eagle = 568 + 2 * Number of Owl + Number of Blue Jay
- From the fourth equation, we have:
Number of Owl = 569 + Number of Blue Jay
- Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
Number of Eagle = 568 + 2 * (569 + Number of Blue Jay) + Number of Blue Jay
- Simplifying, we have:
Number of Eagle = 568 + 1138 + 3 * Number of Blue Jay
- Therefore, the number of Eagle is:
**Answer: 1906 + 3 * Number of Blue Jay**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as h; so h = 733. Define Owl as N; r = h = 733; so N = 569 + r = 569 + 733 = 1302. Define Parrot as J; so J = N + h = 1302 + 733 = 2035. Define Eagle as s; b = J + N = 2035 + 1302 = 3337; so s = 568 + b = 568 + 3337 = 3905. Answer: 3905.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 568 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of owl.
- the number of blue jay equals 733.
- the number of parrot equals the sum of the number of owl and the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals 569 plus the number of blue jay.

**calculation:**

- from the third equation, we have:
number of parrot = number of owl + number of blue jay
- from the first equation, we have:
number of eagle = 568 + number of parrot + number of owl
- substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
number of eagle = 568 + (number of owl + number of blue jay) + number of owl
- combining like terms, we have:
number of eagle = 568 + 2 * number of owl + number of blue jay
- from the fourth equation, we have:
number of owl = 569 + number of blue jay
- substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
number of eagle = 568 + 2 * (569 + number of blue jay) + number of blue jay
- simplifying, we have:
number of eagle = 568 + 1138 + 3 * number of blue jay
- therefore, the number of eagle is:
**answer: 1906 + 3 * number of blue jay**<eos>

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location.

Define Parrot as w; so w = 400. Define Eagle as Z; V = w = 400; so Z = 483 + V = 483 + 400 = 883. Define Crow as v; H = Z + w = 883 + 400 = 1283; so v = 578 + H = 578 + 1283 = 1861. Define Blue Jay as r; n = v + Z = 1861 + 883 = 2744; so r = 691 + n = 691 + 2744 = 3435. Answer: 3435.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot is 400.
- the number of eagle is 483 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of blue jay is 691 plus the sum of the number of crow and the number of eagle.
- the number of owl is 595.
- the number of crow is 578 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of parrot.

- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Owl, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 234 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 881 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 668.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Parrot as:
Number of Parrot = 234 + Number of Owl = 234 + 668 = 902
- We can then calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Number of Blue Jay = 881 + Number of Parrot + Number of Owl = 881 + 902 + 668 = 2451
- Finally, we can calculate the number of Eagle as:
Number of Eagle = Number of Blue Jay + Number of Owl + Number of Parrot = 2451 + 668 + 902 = 3921

**Answer: 3921**<eos>
Define Owl as d; so d = 668. Define Parrot as v; X = d = 668; so v = 234 + X = 234 + 668 = 902. Define Blue Jay as b; Z = v + d = 902 + 668 = 1570; so b = 881 + Z = 881 + 1570 = 2451. Define Eagle as A; u = b + d = 2451 + 668 = 3119; so A = u + v = 3119 + 902 = 4021. Answer: 4021.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 21 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 369.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 597 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 710 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have: Owl = 21 + Eagle
- From the second equation, we have: Eagle = 369
- Substituting the value of Eagle from the second equation into the first equation, we get: Owl = 21 + 369 = 390
- From the fourth equation, we have: Parrot = 710 + (Owl + Eagle)
- Substituting the values of Owl and Eagle from above, we get: Parrot = 710 + (390 + 369) = 1469
- From the third equation, we have: Blue Jay = 597 + Parrot
- Substituting the value of Parrot from above, we get: Blue Jay = 597 + 1469 = 2066

**Answer: 2066**<eos>
Define Eagle as N; so N = 369. Define Owl as m; x = N = 369; so m = 21 + x = 21 + 369 = 390. Define Parrot as R; s = m + N = 390 + 369 = 759; so R = 710 + s = 710 + 759 = 1469. Define Blue Jay as a; l = R = 1469; so a = 597 + l = 597 + 1469 = 2066. Answer: 2066.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals 21 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 369.
- the number of blue jay equals 597 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 710 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of eagle.

Define Wolf as K; so K = 599. Define Bear as G; M = K = 599; so G = 266 + M = 266 + 599 = 865. Define Fox as W; so W = G = 865. Define Deer as F; r = W + K = 865 + 599 = 1464; o = r + G = 1464 + 865 = 2329; so F = 211 + o = 211 + 2329 = 2540. Answer: 2540.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf is 599.
- the number of deer equals 211 plus the sum of the number of fox, the number of wolf, and the number of bear.
- the number of fox equals the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 266 plus the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- the number of fox is equal to the number of bear, which is x.
- the number of deer is equal to 211 + x + 599 + x = 810 + 2x.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 244 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 941.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 873 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 195 plus the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Eagle = 244 + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Parrot
- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Blue Jay = 873 + Number of Parrot + Number of Owl
- Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 873 + (195 + Number of Owl) + Number of Owl
- Simplifying, we have:
Number of Blue Jay = 1068 + 2 * Number of Owl
- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Eagle = 244 + 1068 + 2 * Number of Owl
- Combining like terms, we have:
Number of Eagle = 1312 + 2 * Number of Owl

**Answer: Answer: 1312 + 2 * Number of Owl**<eos>
Define Owl as X; so X = 941. Define Parrot as w; W = X = 941; so w = 195 + W = 195 + 941 = 1136. Define Blue Jay as V; z = w + X = 1136 + 941 = 2077; so V = 873 + z = 873 + 2077 = 2950. Define Eagle as C; a = V + w = 2950 + 1136 = 4086; so C = 244 + a = 244 + 4086 = 4330. Answer: 4330.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 244 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals 941.
- the number of blue jay equals 873 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of owl.
- the number of parrot equals 195 plus the number of owl.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have:
number of eagle = 244 + number of blue jay + number of parrot
- from the third equation, we have:
number of blue jay = 873 + number of parrot + number of owl
- substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:
number of blue jay = 873 + (195 + number of owl) + number of owl
- simplifying, we have:
number of blue jay = 1068 + 2 * number of owl
- from the first equation, we have:
number of eagle = 244 + 1068 + 2 * number of owl
- combining like terms, we have:
number of eagle = 1312 + 2 * number of owl

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 692 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 934 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 332.
- The number of Wolf equals 737 plus the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Fox = 692 + Number of Deer
- From the second equation, we have:
Number of Deer = 934 + Wolf + Bear
- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Bear = 332
- From the fourth equation, we have:
Number of Wolf = 737 + Number of Bear
- Substituting the expression for Number of Deer and Number of Bear from the second and third equations into the first equation, we get:
Number of Fox = 692 + (934 + Wolf + 332)
- Simplifying, we get:
Number of Fox = 692 + 1266 + Wolf
- Combining like terms, we get:
Number of Fox = 1968 + Wolf
- We do not have any information about the number of Wolf, so we cannot calculate the number of Fox.

**Answer: Answer: Cannot be determined**<eos>
Define Bear as N; so N = 332. Define Wolf as y; r = N = 332; so y = 737 + r = 737 + 332 = 1069. Define Deer as L; I = y + N = 1069 + 332 = 1401; so L = 934 + I = 934 + 1401 = 2335. Define Fox as S; m = L = 2335; so S = 692 + m = 692 + 2335 = 3027. Answer: 3027.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals 692 plus the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 934 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 332.
- the number of wolf equals 737 plus the number of bear.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have:
number of fox = 692 + number of deer
- from the second equation, we have:
number of deer = 934 + wolf + bear
- from the third equation, we have:
number of bear = 332
- from the fourth equation, we have:
number of wolf = 737 + number of bear
- substituting the expression for number of deer and number of bear from the second and third equations into the first equation, we get:
number of fox = 692 + (934 + wolf + 332)
- simplifying, we get:
number of fox = 692 + 1266 + wolf
- combining like terms, we get:
number of fox = 1968 + wolf
- we do not have any information about the number of wolf, so we cannot calculate the number of fox.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals 698 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 728 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 80.
- The number of Raccoon equals 725 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- From the first premise, we know that the number of Bear equals the number of Deer. Let's call this number x.
- From the third premise, we know that the number of Deer equals 728 plus the number of Wolf. So, x = 728 + 80 = 808.
- From the second premise, we know that the number of Fox equals 698 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer. So, the number of Fox = 698 + x + x = 698 + 808 = 1506.
- From the fifth premise, we know that the number of Raccoon equals 725 plus the number of Fox. So, the number of Raccoon = 725 + 1506 = 2231.

**Answer: 2231**<eos>
Define Deer as b; x = None = 80; so b = 728 + x = 728 + 80 = 808. Define Bear as j; so j = b = 808. Define Fox as l; w = j + b = 808 + 808 = 1616; so l = 698 + w = 698 + 1616 = 2314. Define Raccoon as L; I = l = 2314; so L = 725 + I = 725 + 2314 = 3039. Answer: 3039.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals the number of deer.
- the number of fox equals 698 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 728 plus the number of wolf.

- The number of Blue Jay is 809 + 5 + 245 = 1109.

**Answer: 1109**<eos>
Define Eagle as W; so W = 5. Define Owl as b; a = W = 5; so b = 240 + a = 240 + 5 = 245. Define Parrot as z; P = b + W = 245 + 5 = 250; so z = 564 + P = 564 + 250 = 814. Define Blue Jay as S; f = z + W = 814 + 5 = 819; so S = f + b = 819 + 245 = 1064. Answer: 1064.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals 240 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of parrot equals 564 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 5.
- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of parrot, the number of eagle, and the number of owl.

**calculation:**

- the number of eagle is 5.
- the number of owl is 240 + 5 = 245.
- the number of parrot is 564 + 245 = 809.
- the number of blue jay is 809 + 5 + 245 = 1109.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 760 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 504 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 721 plus the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf equals 721 + 504 = 1225.
- The sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear equals 1225 + 760 = 1985.
- The number of Deer equals 760 + 1985 = 2745.

**Answer: 2745**<eos>
Define Fox as y; so y = 331. Define Bear as l; T = y = 331; so l = 504 + T = 504 + 331 = 835. Define Wolf as L; V = l = 835; so L = 721 + V = 721 + 835 = 1556. Define Deer as A; r = L + l = 1556 + 835 = 2391; so A = 760 + r = 760 + 2391 = 3151. Answer: 3151.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 834 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 739.
- The number of Bear equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Fox equals 811 plus the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Wolf, and the number of Raccoon.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Deer = Number of Fox + Number of Raccoon
- From the second equation, we have:
Number of Raccoon = 834 + Number of Wolf
- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Wolf = 739
- From the fourth equation, we have:
Number of Bear = Number of Raccoon
- From the fifth equation, we have:
Number of Fox = 811 + Number of Bear + Number of Wolf + Number of Raccoon
- Substituting the values we know, we get:
Number of Fox = 811 + (834 + 739) + 834
- Simplifying, we get:
Number of Fox = 811 + 1573 + 834
- Adding, we get:
Number of Fox = 3210

**Answer: 3210**<eos>
Define Wolf as A; so A = 739. Define Raccoon as G; e = A = 739; so G = 834 + e = 834 + 739 = 1573. Define Bear as P; so P = G = 1573. Define Fox as W; v = P + A = 1573 + 739 = 2312; l = v + G = 2312 + 1573 = 3885; so W = 811 + l = 811 + 3885 = 4696. Answer: 4696.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of fox and the number of raccoon.
- the number of raccoon equals 834 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 739.
- the number of bear equals the number of raccoon.
- the number of fox equals 811 plus the sum of the number of bear, the number of wolf, and the number of raccoon.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have:
number of deer = number of fox + number of raccoon
- from the second equation, we have:
number of raccoon = 834 + number of wolf
- from the third equation, we have:
number of wolf = 739
- from the fourth equation, we have:
number of bear = number of raccoon
- from the fifth equation, we have:
number of fox = 811 + number of bear + number of wolf + number of raccoon
- substituting the values we know, we get:
number of fox = 811 + (834 + 739) + 834
- simplifying, we get:
number of fox = 811 + 1573 + 834
- adding, we get:
number of fox = 3210

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 21 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 971.
- The number of Owl equals 761 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals 143 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot equals 21 + (Eagle + Blue Jay)
- The number of Parrot equals 21 + (143 + Blue Jay) (because Eagle equals 143 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Blue Jay)
- The number of Parrot equals 21 + 143 + Blue Jay
- The number of Parrot equals 164 + Blue Jay

- The number of Blue Jay equals 971
- The number of Parrot equals 164 + 971
- The number of Parrot equals 1135

**Answer: 1135**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as j; so j = 971. Define Owl as G; I = j = 971; so G = 761 + I = 761 + 971 = 1732. Define Eagle as x; E = G + j = 1732 + 971 = 2703; so x = 143 + E = 143 + 2703 = 2846. Define Parrot as r; F = x + j = 2846 + 971 = 3817; so r = 21 + F = 21 + 3817 = 3838. Answer: 3838.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 21 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals 971.
- the number of owl equals 761 plus the number of blue jay.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf is 230.
- The number of Bear is the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox is 946 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer is 901 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear = the number of Fox + the number of Wolf + the number of Deer
= (946 + the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf) + 230 + (901 + the number of Wolf)
= 946 + 901 + 230 + the number of Wolf + the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf
= 1877 + 2*the number of Wolf + the sum of the number of Deer

- The sum of the number of Deer is 901 plus the number of Wolf, so the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf is 901 + the number of Wolf.

- Therefore, the number of Bear = 1877 + 2*230 + (901 + 230) = 4348.

**Answer: 4348**<eos>
Define Wolf as r; so r = 230. Define Deer as i; D = r = 230; so i = 901 + D = 901 + 230 = 1131. Define Fox as k; N = i + r = 1131 + 230 = 1361; so k = 946 + N = 946 + 1361 = 2307. Define Bear as b; L = k + r = 2307 + 230 = 2537; so b = L + i = 2537 + 1131 = 3668. Answer: 3668.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf is 230.
- the number of bear is the sum of the number of fox, the number of wolf, and the number of deer.
- the number of fox is 946 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf.
- the number of deer is 901 plus the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- the number of bear = the number of fox + the number of wolf + the number of deer
= (946 + the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf) + 230 + (901 + the number of wolf)
= 946 + 901 + 230 + the number of wolf + the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf
= 1877 + 2*the number of wolf + the sum of the number of deer

- the sum of the number of deer is 901 plus the number of wolf, so the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf is 901 + the number of wolf.

- therefore, the number of bear = 1877 + 2*230 + (901 + 230) = 4348.

- The number of Parrot equals 841 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 310.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have the number of Eagle = 653 + 310 = 963.
- From the third equation, we have the number of Parrot = 841 + 963 = 1804.
- From the second equation, we have the number of Owl = 558 + (1804 + 310) = 2412.

**Answer: 2412**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as K; so K = 310. Define Eagle as Q; e = K = 310; so Q = 653 + e = 653 + 310 = 963. Define Parrot as F; s = Q + K = 963 + 310 = 1273; so F = 841 + s = 841 + 1273 = 2114. Define Owl as Z; w = F + K = 2114 + 310 = 2424; so Z = 558 + w = 558 + 2424 = 2982. Answer: 2982.

- The number of Deer equals 52 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 877.
- The number of Wolf equals 574 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 182 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf equals 574 + (Bear + Fox) = 574 + (182 + 877) = 574 + 1059 = 1633.
- The number of Deer equals 52 + (Wolf + Bear) = 52 + (1633 + 182) = 52 + 1815 = 1867.

- The number of Deer is 721 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear is 501 + 678 = 1179.
- The number of Fox is 1179 (because the number of Fox equals the number of Bear).
- The sum of the number of Wolf, Fox, and Bear is 678 + 1179 + 1179 = 3036.
- The number of Deer is 721 + 3036 = 3757.

**Answer: 3757**<eos>
Define Wolf as u; so u = 678. Define Bear as D; M = u = 678; so D = 501 + M = 501 + 678 = 1179. Define Fox as C; so C = D = 1179. Define Deer as N; U = C + u = 1179 + 678 = 1857; a = U + D = 1857 + 1179 = 3036; so N = 721 + a = 721 + 3036 = 3757. Answer: 3757.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 70 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals 211 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 308 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 103.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl:
Number of Owl = 70 + (Number of Eagle + Number of Blue Jay)
- We can also calculate the number of Eagle:
Number of Eagle = 308 - Number of Blue Jay
- Substituting the above equation into the equation for the number of Owl, we get:
Number of Owl = 70 + (308 - Number of Blue Jay + Number of Blue Jay)
Number of Owl = 70 + 308
Number of Owl = 378
- Substituting the number of Owl into the equation for the number of Parrot, we get:
Number of Parrot = 211 + Number of Owl
Number of Parrot = 211 + 378
Number of Parrot = 589

**Answer: 589**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as l; so l = 103. Define Eagle as R; Q = l = 103; so R = 308 + Q = 308 + 103 = 411. Define Owl as n; Y = R + l = 411 + 103 = 514; so n = 70 + Y = 70 + 514 = 584. Define Parrot as x; D = n = 584; so x = 211 + D = 211 + 584 = 795. Answer: 795.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals 70 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of blue jay.
- the number of parrot equals 211 plus the number of owl.
- the number of eagle equals 308 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals 103.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of owl:
number of owl = 70 + (number of eagle + number of blue jay)
- we can also calculate the number of eagle:
number of eagle = 308 - number of blue jay
- substituting the above equation into the equation for the number of owl, we get:
number of owl = 70 + (308 - number of blue jay + number of blue jay)
number of owl = 70 + 308
number of owl = 378
- substituting the number of owl into the equation for the number of parrot, we get:
number of parrot = 211 + number of owl
number of parrot = 211 + 378
number of parrot = 589

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay is 196.
- The number of Eagle equals 65 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 892 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 721 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Parrot = 892 + Number of Owl + Number of Blue Jay
- From the first and fourth equations, we have:
Number of Owl = 721 + Number of Blue Jay
- Substituting the above equation into the third equation, we get:
Number of Parrot = 892 + (721 + Number of Blue Jay) + Number of Blue Jay
- Simplifying the equation, we have:
Number of Parrot = 1613 + 2 * Number of Blue Jay
- From the second equation, we have:
Number of Eagle = 65 + Number of Parrot
- Substituting the above equation for Number of Parrot, we get:
Number of Eagle = 65 + 1613 + 2 * Number of Blue Jay
- Simplifying the equation, we have:
Number of Eagle = 1678 + 2 * Number of Blue Jay

**Answer: Answer: 1678 + 2 * 196 = 2166**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as k; so k = 196. Define Owl as Q; O = k = 196; so Q = 721 + O = 721 + 196 = 917. Define Parrot as m; J = Q + k = 917 + 196 = 1113; so m = 892 + J = 892 + 1113 = 2005. Define Eagle as F; f = m = 2005; so F = 65 + f = 65 + 2005 = 2070. Answer: 2070.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay is 196.
- the number of eagle equals 65 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 892 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals 721 plus the number of blue jay.

**calculation:**

- from the third equation, we have:
number of parrot = 892 + number of owl + number of blue jay
- from the first and fourth equations, we have:
number of owl = 721 + number of blue jay
- substituting the above equation into the third equation, we get:
number of parrot = 892 + (721 + number of blue jay) + number of blue jay
- simplifying the equation, we have:
number of parrot = 1613 + 2 * number of blue jay
- from the second equation, we have:
number of eagle = 65 + number of parrot
- substituting the above equation for number of parrot, we get:
number of eagle = 65 + 1613 + 2 * number of blue jay

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 29 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 269 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 664 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 948.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Parrot = 29 + Number of Eagle
- From the second equation, we have:
Number of Eagle = 269 + Owl + Blue Jay
- From the third equation, we have:
Owl = 664 + Blue Jay
- Substituting the third equation into the second equation, we get:
Number of Eagle = 269 + (664 + Blue Jay) + Blue Jay
- Simplifying, we have:
Number of Eagle = 269 + 664 + 2 * Blue Jay
- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Parrot = 29 + Number of Eagle
- Substituting the expression for Number of Eagle, we get:
Number of Parrot = 29 + 269 + 664 + 2 * Blue Jay
- Simplifying, we have:
Number of Parrot = 956 + 2 * Blue Jay
- Since the number of Blue Jay is 948, we have:
Number of Parrot = 956 + 2 * 948 = 3852

**Answer: 3852**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as h; so h = 948. Define Owl as F; G = h = 948; so F = 664 + G = 664 + 948 = 1612. Define Eagle as Z; X = F + h = 1612 + 948 = 2560; so Z = 269 + X = 269 + 2560 = 2829. Define Parrot as k; I = Z = 2829; so k = 29 + I = 29 + 2829 = 2858. Answer: 2858.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 29 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 269 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals 664 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals 948.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have:
number of parrot = 29 + number of eagle
- from the second equation, we have:
number of eagle = 269 + owl + blue jay
- from the third equation, we have:
owl = 664 + blue jay
- substituting the third equation into the second equation, we get:
number of eagle = 269 + (664 + blue jay) + blue jay
- simplifying, we have:
number of eagle = 269 + 664 + 2 * blue jay
- from the first equation, we have:
number of parrot = 29 + number of eagle
- substituting the expression for number of eagle, we get:
number of parrot = 29 + 269 + 664 + 2 * blue jay
- simplifying, we have:
number of parrot = 956 + 2 * blue jay
- since the number of blue jay is 948, we have:
number of parrot = 956 + 2 * 948 = 3852

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 767 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 123 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 610 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 82.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have the number of Wolf equals 767 - Deer.
- From the second equation, we have the number of Bear equals 123 + Fox + Wolf.
- From the third equation, we have the number of Deer equals Fox - Wolf.
- Substituting the expression for Wolf from the first equation into the third equation, we get:
  Deer = Fox - (767 - Deer)
  2 * Deer = Fox + 767
  Fox = 2 * Deer - 767
- Substituting the expressions for Fox and Deer into the second equation, we get:
  Bear = 123 + (2 * Deer - 767) + 82
  Bear = 123 - 665 + 82
  **Bear = -520**

**Answer: -520**<eos>
Define Wolf as A; so A = 82. Define Deer as l; X = A = 82; so l = 767 + X = 767 + 82 = 849. Define Fox as q; U = l + A = 849 + 82 = 931; so q = 610 + U = 610 + 931 = 1541. Define Bear as G; J = q + A = 1541 + 82 = 1623; so G = 123 + J = 123 + 1623 = 1746. Answer: 1746.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals 767 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of bear equals 123 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of wolf.
- the number of fox equals 610 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 82.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have the number of wolf equals 767 - deer.
- from the second equation, we have the number of bear equals 123 + fox + wolf.
- from the third equation, we have the number of deer equals fox - wolf.
- substituting the expression for wolf from the first equation into the third equation, we get:
  deer = fox - (767 - deer)
  2 * deer = fox + 767
  fox = 2 * deer - 767
- substituting the expressions for fox and deer into the second equation, we get:
  bear = 123 + (2 * deer - 767) + 82
  bear = 123 - 665 + 82
  **bear = -520**

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 442 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 991 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 639.
- The number of Owl equals 679.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot = 442 + (Eagle + Blue Jay + Crow)
- The number of Crow = 991 + Blue Jay
- The number of Eagle = Crow = 991 + Blue Jay
- The number of Blue Jay = 639

- Substituting the values of Blue Jay into the other equations, we get:
  - The number of Parrot = 442 + (991 + Blue Jay + Blue Jay) = 442 + 1982 + 2 * Blue Jay
  - The number of Crow = 991 + 639 = 1630

- Solving for Blue Jay:
  - 1630 = 991 + 639 + 2 * Blue Jay
  - 2 * Blue Jay = 1630 - 991 - 639 = 100
  - Blue Jay = 100/2 = 50

- Substituting the value of Blue Jay back into the other equations, we get:
  - The number of Parrot = 442 + 1982 + 2 * 50 = 2564
  - The number of Eagle = 1630

**Answer: 2564**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as b; so b = 639. Define Crow as h; T = b = 639; so h = 991 + T = 991 + 639 = 1630. Define Eagle as K; so K = h = 1630. Define Parrot as t; Q = K + b = 1630 + 639 = 2269; d = Q + h = 2269 + 1630 = 3899; so t = 442 + d = 442 + 3899 = 4341. Answer: 4341.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 442 plus the sum of the number of eagle, the number of blue jay, and the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals 991 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of eagle equals the number of crow.
- the number of blue jay equals 639.
- the number of owl equals 679.

**calculation:**

- the number of parrot = 442 + (eagle + blue jay + crow)
- the number of crow = 991 + blue jay
- the number of eagle = crow = 991 + blue jay
- the number of blue jay = 639

- substituting the values of blue jay into the other equations, we get:
  - the number of parrot = 442 + (991 + blue jay + blue jay) = 442 + 1982 + 2 * blue jay
  - the number of crow = 991 + 639 = 1630

- solving for blue jay:
  - 1630 = 991 + 639 + 2 * blue jay
  - 2 * blue jay = 1630 - 991 - 639 = 100
  - blue jay = 100/2 = 50

- substituting the value of blue jay back into the other equations, we get:
  - the number of parrot = 442 + 1982 + 2 * 50 = 2564
  - the number of eagle = 1630

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 597 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 219 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 840 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 490.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Owl = 597 + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Eagle
- From the second equation, we have:
Number of Parrot = 219 + Number of Owl
- From the third equation, we have:
Number of Blue Jay = 840 + Number of Eagle
- From the fourth equation, we have:
Number of Eagle = 490
- Substitute the value of Number of Eagle from the fourth equation into the third equation:
Number of Blue Jay = 840 + 490 = 1330
- Substitute the value of Number of Blue Jay from the third equation into the second equation:
Number of Parrot = 219 + 1330 = 1549
- Therefore, the number of Parrot is 1549.

**Answer: 1549**<eos>
Define Eagle as b; so b = 490. Define Blue Jay as e; t = b = 490; so e = 840 + t = 840 + 490 = 1330. Define Owl as d; V = e + b = 1330 + 490 = 1820; so d = 597 + V = 597 + 1820 = 2417. Define Parrot as C; q = d = 2417; so C = 219 + q = 219 + 2417 = 2636. Answer: 2636.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals 597 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of eagle.
- the number of parrot equals 219 plus the number of owl.
- the number of blue jay equals 840 plus the number of eagle.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 572 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 872 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 102 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 355.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Fox as follows:
Number of Fox = 102 + (Number of Wolf + Number of Bear)
= 102 + (872 + 355)
= 102 + 1227
= 1329

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Deer as follows:
Number of Deer = 572 + (Number of Fox + Number of Bear)
= 572 + (1329 + 355)
= 572 + 1684
= 2256

**Answer: 2256**<eos>
Define Bear as z; so z = 355. Define Wolf as N; j = z = 355; so N = 872 + j = 872 + 355 = 1227. Define Fox as M; u = N + z = 1227 + 355 = 1582; so M = 102 + u = 102 + 1582 = 1684. Define Deer as k; s = M + z = 1684 + 355 = 2039; so k = 572 + s = 572 + 2039 = 2611. Answer: 2611.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals 572 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals 872 plus the number of bear.
- the number of fox equals 102 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 355.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of fox as follows:
number of fox = 102 + (number of wolf + number of bear)
= 102 + (872 + 355)
= 102 + 1227
= 1329

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of deer as follows:
number of deer = 572 + (number of fox + number of bear)
= 572 + (1329 + 355)
= 572 + 1684
= 2256

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 591 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Blue Jay, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 59 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 342.
- The number of Crow equals 192 plus the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle as:
Number of Eagle = 59 + (Number of Crow + Number of Owl)
- We can also calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Number of Blue Jay = 591 + Number of Eagle
- Substituting the expression for Number of Eagle from the previous step into the equation for Number of Blue Jay, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 591 + (59 + (Number of Crow + Number of Owl))
- Simplifying this equation, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 650 + Number of Crow + Number of Owl
- We can calculate the number of Crow as:
Number of Crow = 192 + Number of Owl
- Substituting this expression for Number of Crow into the equation for Number of Blue Jay, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 650 + (192 + Number of Owl) + Number of Owl
- Simplifying this equation, we get:

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 60 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 170 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 438 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals 181.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Wolf:
Number of Wolf = 60 + (Number of Deer + Number of Fox)
Number of Wolf = 60 + (170 + 181)
Number of Wolf = 60 + 351
Number of Wolf = 411

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Deer:
Number of Deer = 170 + Number of Fox
Number of Deer = 170 + 181
Number of Deer = 351

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Bear:
Number of Bear = 438 + (Number of Wolf + Number of Deer)
Number of Bear = 438 + (411 + 351)
Number of Bear = 438 + 762
Number of Bear = 1200

**Answer: 1200**<eos>
Define Fox as V; so V = 181. Define Deer as A; W = V = 181; so A = 170 + W = 170 + 181 = 351. Define Wolf as L; F = A + V = 351 + 181 = 532; so L = 60 + F = 60 + 532 = 592. Define Bear as w; u = L + A = 592 + 351 = 943; so w = 438 + u = 438 + 943 = 1381. Answer: 1381.

Define Eagle as e; so e = 461. Define Owl as n; w = e = 461; so n = 250 + w = 250 + 461 = 711. Define Blue Jay as I; Z = n + e = 711 + 461 = 1172; so I = 546 + Z = 546 + 1172 = 1718. Define Parrot as c; x = I + e = 1718 + 461 = 2179; so c = 245 + x = 245 + 2179 = 2424. Answer: 2424.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay equals 546 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 461.
- the number of parrot equals 245 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals 250 plus the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- the number of owl is 250 + 461 = 711.
- the number of blue jay is 546 + 711 = 1257.
- the number of parrot is 245 + 1257 = 1502.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 141 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 85 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 69 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 291.

**Calculation:**

1. From the equation "The number of Deer equals 291", we have the number of Deer as 291.
2. From the equation "The number of Fox equals 69 plus the number of Deer", we can substitute the value of Deer to get:
Number of Fox = 69 + 291 = 360.
3. From the equation "The number of Wolf equals 85 plus the number of Fox", we can substitute the value of Fox to get:
Number of Wolf = 85 + 360 = 445.
4. From the equation "The number of Bear equals 141 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox", we can substitute the values of Wolf and Fox to get:
Number of Bear = 141 + (445 + 360) = 141 + 805 = 946.

**Answer: 946**<eos>
Define Deer as H; so H = 291. Define Fox as e; d = H = 291; so e = 69 + d = 69 + 291 = 360. Define Wolf as T; w = e = 360; so T = 85 + w = 85 + 360 = 445. Define Bear as t; h = T + e = 445 + 360 = 805; so t = 141 + h = 141 + 805 = 946. Answer: 946.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 141 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of fox.
- the number of wolf equals 85 plus the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 69 plus the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 291.

**calculation:**

1. from the equation "the number of deer equals 291", we have the number of deer as 291.
2. from the equation "the number of fox equals 69 plus the number of deer", we can substitute the value of deer to get:
number of fox = 69 + 291 = 360.
3. from the equation "the number of wolf equals 85 plus the number of fox", we can substitute the value of fox to get:
number of wolf = 85 + 360 = 445.
4. from the equation "the number of bear equals 141 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of fox", we can substitute the values of wolf and fox to get:
number of bear = 141 + (445 + 360) = 141 + 805 = 946.

- The number of Wolf equals 576 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 287 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 354.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Deer = Fox + Bear + Wolf
- The number of Wolf = 576 + Bear
- The number of Fox = 287 + Wolf + Bear
- The number of Bear = 354
- Substitute the value of Bear into the equation for Wolf:
  The number of Wolf = 576 + 354 = 930
- Substitute the value of Wolf into the equation for Fox:
  The number of Fox = 287 + 930 + 354 = 1571
- Substitute the values of Fox and Wolf into the equation for Deer:
  The number of Deer = 1571 + 354 + 930 = 3855

**Answer: 3855**<eos>
Define Bear as D; so D = 354. Define Wolf as h; i = D = 354; so h = 576 + i = 576 + 354 = 930. Define Fox as P; e = h + D = 930 + 354 = 1284; so P = 287 + e = 287 + 1284 = 1571. Define Deer as m; n = P + D = 1571 + 354 = 1925; so m = n + h = 1925 + 930 = 2855. Answer: 2855.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon equals 876 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 690 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 903.
- The number of Bear equals 842 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Deer equals the number of Fox, so let's assume both are x.
- The number of Raccoon is x + 876.
- The number of Wolf is 690 + x + 876 = 1566 + x.
- The number of Bear is 842 + 1566 + x = 2408 + x.

**Answer: Answer: 2408 + x**<eos>
Define Fox as L; so L = 903. Define Raccoon as u; y = L = 903; so u = 876 + y = 876 + 903 = 1779. Define Wolf as U; w = u + L = 1779 + 903 = 2682; so U = 690 + w = 690 + 2682 = 3372. Define Bear as q; z = U = 3372; so q = 842 + z = 842 + 3372 = 4214. Answer: 4214.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 119.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Deer, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 674 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 110 plus the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can write:
Number of Bear = Number of Fox + Number of Deer + Number of Wolf
- We can also write:
Number of Fox = 674 + Number of Wolf
Number of Wolf = 110 + Number of Deer
- Substituting these expressions into the first equation, we get:
Number of Bear = (674 + Number of Wolf) + 119 + (110 + Number of Deer)
- Simplifying, we get:
Number of Bear = 803 + 229 + Number of Deer
- Therefore, the number of Bear is 1032 + Number of Deer.

**Answer: 1032 + 119 = 1151**<eos>
Define Deer as B; so B = 119. Define Wolf as D; h = B = 119; so D = 110 + h = 110 + 119 = 229. Define Fox as H; Z = D = 229; so H = 674 + Z = 674 + 229 = 903. Define Bear as l; w = H + B = 903 + 119 = 1022; so l = w + D = 1022 + 229 = 1251. Answer: 1251.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals 119.
- the number of bear equals the sum of the number of fox, the number of deer, and the number of wolf.
- the number of fox equals 674 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 110 plus the number of deer.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can write:
number of bear = number of fox + number of deer + number of wolf
- we can also write:
number of fox = 674 + number of wolf
number of wolf = 110 + number of deer
- substituting these expressions into the first equation, we get:
number of bear = (674 + number of wolf) + 119 + (110 + number of deer)
- simplifying, we get:
number of bear = 803 + 229 + number of deer
- therefore, the number of bear is 1032 + number of deer.

**answer: 1032 + 119 = 1151**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 466 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Deer, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 992 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 565.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox = 466 + (Wolf + Deer) = 466 + (992 + 565) = 466 + 1557 = 2023.
- The number of Bear = Fox + Deer + Wolf = 2023 + 565 + 992 = 3570.

**Answer: 3570**<eos>
Define Deer as d; so d = 565. Define Wolf as g; Q = d = 565; so g = 992 + Q = 992 + 565 = 1557. Define Fox as F; G = g + d = 1557 + 565 = 2122; so F = 466 + G = 466 + 2122 = 2588. Define Bear as N; w = F + d = 2588 + 565 = 3153; so N = w + g = 3153 + 1557 = 4710. Answer: 4710.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals 466 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of deer.
- the number of bear equals the sum of the number of fox, the number of deer, and the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 992 plus the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 565.

**calculation:**

- the number of fox = 466 + (wolf + deer) = 466 + (992 + 565) = 466 + 1557 = 2023.
- the number of bear = fox + deer + wolf = 2023 + 565 + 992 = 3570.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 258 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 49.
- The number of Owl equals 20 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 69 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot = 258 + (Blue Jay + Eagle)
- The number of Blue Jay = 69 + Eagle
- The number of Eagle = 49
- Substitute the number of Eagle into the equations for the number of Parrot and Blue Jay:
  - The number of Parrot = 258 + (69 + 49) = 258 + 127 = 385
  - The number of Blue Jay = 69 + 49 = 118
- The number of Owl = 20 + the number of Parrot = 20 + 385 = 405

**Answer: 405**<eos>
Define Eagle as J; so J = 49. Define Blue Jay as y; d = J = 49; so y = 69 + d = 69 + 49 = 118. Define Parrot as P; L = y + J = 118 + 49 = 167; so P = 258 + L = 258 + 167 = 425. Define Owl as u; S = P = 425; so u = 20 + S = 20 + 425 = 445. Answer: 445.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 258 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 49.
- the number of owl equals 20 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of blue jay equals 69 plus the number of eagle.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 555 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 260 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 583.
- The number of Owl equals 562 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the fourth equation, we can get the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle:
Number of Owl = 562 + (Number of Blue Jay + Number of Eagle)
Number of Blue Jay + Number of Eagle = Number of Owl - 562
- From the second equation, we can get the number of Eagle:
Number of Blue Jay = 260 + Number of Eagle
Number of Eagle = Number of Blue Jay - 260
- Substitute the above equation into the equation for the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle:
Number of Blue Jay + (Number of Blue Jay - 260) = Number of Owl - 562
2 * Number of Blue Jay = Number of Owl - 562
Number of Blue Jay = (Number of Owl - 562) / 2
- From the first equation, we can get the number of Parrot:
Number of Parrot = 555 + Number of Owl
Number of Parrot = 555 + (Number of Owl - 562) / 2
Number of Parrot = 555 - 311 / 2
Number of Parrot = 555 - 155.5
**Answer: 409.5**<eos>
Define Eagle as I; so I = 583. Define Blue Jay as l; W = I = 583; so l = 260 + W = 260 + 583 = 843. Define Owl as F; R = l + I = 843 + 583 = 1426; so F = 562 + R = 562 + 1426 = 1988. Define Parrot as j; Z = F = 1988; so j = 555 + Z = 555 + 1988 = 2543. Answer: 2543.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 555 plus the number of owl.
- the number of blue jay equals 260 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 583.
- the number of owl equals 562 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- from the fourth equation, we can get the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of eagle:
number of owl = 562 + (number of blue jay + number of eagle)
number of blue jay + number of eagle = number of owl - 562
- from the second equation, we can get the number of eagle:
number of blue jay = 260 + number of eagle
number of eagle = number of blue jay - 260
- substitute the above equation into the equation for the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of eagle:
number of blue jay + (number of blue jay - 260) = number of owl - 562
2 * number of blue jay = number of owl - 562
number of blue jay = (number of owl - 562) / 2
- from the first equation, we can get the number of parrot:
number of parrot = 555 + number of owl
number of parrot = 555 + (number of owl - 562) / 2
number of parrot = 555 - 311 / 2
number of parrot = 555 - 155.5

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 993 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 646 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 3.

**Calculation:**

- From the third equation, we have the number of Owl = 3.
- Substituting the value of Owl into the second equation, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 993 + (Eagle + 3)
- Substituting the value of Blue Jay into the first equation, we get:
Number of Parrot = (993 + (Eagle + 3)) + 3 + Eagle
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
Number of Parrot = 999 + 2*Eagle
- Since the number of Eagle is not given, we cannot calculate the number of Parrot.

**Answer: Cannot be determined**<eos>
Define Owl as g; so g = 3. Define Eagle as W; t = g = 3; so W = 646 + t = 646 + 3 = 649. Define Blue Jay as x; Z = W + g = 649 + 3 = 652; so x = 993 + Z = 993 + 652 = 1645. Define Parrot as F; U = x + g = 1645 + 3 = 1648; so F = U + W = 1648 + 649 = 2297. Answer: 2297.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of owl, and the number of eagle.
- the number of blue jay equals 993 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of owl.
- the number of eagle equals 646 plus the number of owl.
- the number of owl equals 3.

**calculation:**

- from the third equation, we have the number of owl = 3.
- substituting the value of owl into the second equation, we get:
number of blue jay = 993 + (eagle + 3)
- substituting the value of blue jay into the first equation, we get:
number of parrot = (993 + (eagle + 3)) + 3 + eagle
- simplifying the equation, we get:
number of parrot = 999 + 2*eagle
- since the number of eagle is not given, we cannot calculate the number of parrot.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 370 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Owl, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 119.
- The number of Owl equals 43 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot = 370 + (Owl + Blue Jay) = 370 + (43 + 119) = 370 + 162 = 532.
- The number of Owl = 43 + Blue Jay = 43 + 119 = 162.
- The number of Eagle = Parrot + Owl + Blue Jay = 532 + 162 + 119 = 813.

**Answer: 813**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as n; so n = 119. Define Owl as S; A = n = 119; so S = 43 + A = 43 + 119 = 162. Define Parrot as w; r = S + n = 162 + 119 = 281; so w = 370 + r = 370 + 281 = 651. Define Eagle as P; U = w + S = 651 + 162 = 813; so P = U + n = 813 + 119 = 932. Answer: 932.

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated. Problem: The number of Blue Jay equals 388 plus the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, and the number of Parrot.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 388 plus the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 23.
- The number of Parrot equals 92 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl:
Number of Owl = Number of Parrot + Number of Eagle
Number of Owl = 92 + 23 = 115
- We can also calculate the number of Parrot:
Number of Parrot = Number of Owl - Number of Eagle
Number of Parrot = 115 - 23 = 92
- Finally, we can calculate the number of Blue Jay:
Number of Blue Jay = 388 + Number of Owl + Number of Parrot
Number of Blue Jay = 388 + 115 + 92
**Answer: 595**<eos>
Define Eagle as n; so n = 23. Define Parrot as T; r = n = 23; so T = 92 + r = 92 + 23 = 115. Define Owl as l; so l = T + n = 115 + 23 = 138. Define Blue Jay as U; h = l + n = 138 + 23 = 161; g = h + T = 161 + 115 = 276; so U = 388 + g = 388 + 276 = 664. Answer: 664.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay equals 388 plus the sum of the number of owl, the number of eagle, and the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of parrot and the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 23.
- the number of parrot equals 92 plus the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of owl:
number of owl = number of parrot + number of eagle
number of owl = 92 + 23 = 115
- we can also calculate the number of parrot:
number of parrot = number of owl - number of eagle
number of parrot = 115 - 23 = 92
- finally, we can calculate the number of blue jay:
number of blue jay = 388 + number of owl + number of parrot
number of blue jay = 388 + 115 + 92

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 528 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 370.
- The number of Parrot equals 520 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 7 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 889 plus the number of Crow.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have: Number of Owl = 528 + Number of Parrot
- From the third equation, we have: Number of Parrot = 520 + Sum of Eagle and Crow
- From the fourth equation, we have: Number of Blue Jay = 7 + Number of Owl
- From the fifth equation, we have: Number of Eagle = 889 + Number of Crow
- We can substitute the expressions for Number of Parrot and Number of Eagle from the third and fifth equations into the first and fourth equations, respectively.
- This gives us: Number of Owl = 528 + (520 + Sum of Crow) and Number of Blue Jay = 7 + (528 + Number of Crow)
- We can solve for the Number of Owl and Number of Crow by simplifying these equations:
  - Number of Owl = 1048 + Sum of Crow
  - Number of Crow = Number of Blue Jay - 7

**Answer:**

**Answer: 1048 + Number of Crow**<eos>
Define Crow as M; so M = 370. Define Eagle as P; N = M = 370; so P = 889 + N = 889 + 370 = 1259. Define Parrot as W; b = P + M = 1259 + 370 = 1629; so W = 520 + b = 520 + 1629 = 2149. Define Owl as o; J = W = 2149; so o = 528 + J = 528 + 2149 = 2677. Answer: 2677.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals 528 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of crow equals 370.
- the number of parrot equals 520 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of crow.
- the number of blue jay equals 7 plus the number of owl.
- the number of eagle equals 889 plus the number of crow.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have: number of owl = 528 + number of parrot
- from the third equation, we have: number of parrot = 520 + sum of eagle and crow
- from the fourth equation, we have: number of blue jay = 7 + number of owl
- from the fifth equation, we have: number of eagle = 889 + number of crow
- we can substitute the expressions for number of parrot and number of eagle from the third and fifth equations into the first and fourth equations, respectively.
- this gives us: number of owl = 528 + (520 + sum of crow) and number of blue jay = 7 + (528 + number of crow)
- we can solve for the number of owl and number of crow by simplifying these equations:
  - number of owl = 1048 + sum of crow
  - number of crow = number of blue jay - 7

**answer:**

**answer: 1048 + number of crow**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 892 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 654 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 479.
- The number of Deer equals 143 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear = 654
- The number of Fox = 892 + 654 = 1546
- The number of Wolf = 479
- The sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Bear = 1546 + 479 + 654 = 2679
- The number of Deer = 143 + 2679 = 2822

**Answer: 2822**<eos>
Define Wolf as d; so d = 479. Define Bear as x; R = d = 479; so x = 654 + R = 654 + 479 = 1133. Define Fox as z; b = x = 1133; so z = 892 + b = 892 + 1133 = 2025. Define Deer as T; F = z + d = 2025 + 479 = 2504; V = F + x = 2504 + 1133 = 3637; so T = 143 + V = 143 + 3637 = 3780. Answer: 3780.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 817 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals 329.
- The number of Fox equals 13.
- The number of Bear equals 882 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Fox, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 708 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon is 708 plus the number of Fox, so the number of Fox is 708 - Raccoon = 708 - 708 = 0.
- The number of Wolf is 817 plus the number of Raccoon, so the number of Wolf is 817 + 0 = 817.
- The sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Fox, and the number of Raccoon is 817 + 0 + 0 = 817.
- The number of Bear is 882 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Fox, and the number of Raccoon, so the number of Bear is 882 + 817 = 1699.

**Answer: 1699**<eos>
Define Fox as w; so w = 13. Define Raccoon as K; t = w = 13; so K = 708 + t = 708 + 13 = 721. Define Wolf as Z; J = K = 721; so Z = 817 + J = 817 + 721 = 1538. Define Bear as p; R = Z + w = 1538 + 13 = 1551; v = R + K = 1551 + 721 = 2272; so p = 882 + v = 882 + 2272 = 3154. Answer: 3154.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 817 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of deer equals 329.
- the number of fox equals 13.
- the number of bear equals 882 plus the sum of the number of wolf, the number of fox, and the number of raccoon.
- the number of raccoon equals 708 plus the number of fox.

**calculation:**

- the number of raccoon is 708 plus the number of fox, so the number of fox is 708 - raccoon = 708 - 708 = 0.
- the number of wolf is 817 plus the number of raccoon, so the number of wolf is 817 + 0 = 817.
- the sum of the number of wolf, the number of fox, and the number of raccoon is 817 + 0 + 0 = 817.
- the number of bear is 882 plus the sum of the number of wolf, the number of fox, and the number of raccoon, so the number of bear is 882 + 817 = 1699.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 962 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 611 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 768 plus the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 678.

**Calculation:**

- From the second equation, we have the number of Deer = 611 + 678 = 1289.
- From the first equation, we have the number of Bear = 962 - 1289 = -327. (Since the number of animals cannot be negative, we assume the number of Bear is 0.)
- From the third equation, we have the number of Fox = 768 + (-327 + 678) = 768 + 351 = 1119.

**Answer: 1119**<eos>
Define Wolf as o; so o = 678. Define Deer as P; C = o = 678; so P = 611 + C = 611 + 678 = 1289. Define Bear as H; Y = P = 1289; so H = 962 + Y = 962 + 1289 = 2251. Define Fox as e; z = H + o = 2251 + 678 = 2929; B = z + P = 2929 + 1289 = 4218; so e = 768 + B = 768 + 4218 = 4986. Answer: 4986.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 962 plus the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 611 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of fox equals 768 plus the sum of the number of bear, the number of wolf, and the number of deer.
- the number of wolf equals 678.

**calculation:**

- from the second equation, we have the number of deer = 611 + 678 = 1289.
- from the first equation, we have the number of bear = 962 - 1289 = -327. (since the number of animals cannot be negative, we assume the number of bear is 0.)
- from the third equation, we have the number of fox = 768 + (-327 + 678) = 768 + 351 = 1119.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 730 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Fox, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 828 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 619.
- The number of Bear equals 258 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- From the equation "The number of Deer equals 730 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Fox, and the number of Bear," we can get:
Number of Deer = 730 + Number of Wolf + Number of Fox + Number of Bear

- From the equation "The number of Wolf equals 828 plus the number of Bear," we can get:
Number of Wolf = 828 + Number of Bear

- From the equation "The number of Bear equals 258 plus the number of Fox," we can get:
Number of Bear = 258 + Number of Fox

- Substitute the above two equations into the first equation, we get:
Number of Deer = 730 + (828 + Number of Bear) + 619 + (258 + Number of Fox)

- Simplify the equation:
Number of Deer = 730 + 828 + Number of Bear + 619 + 258 + Number of Fox
Number of Deer = 2425 + Number of Bear + Number of Fox

**Answer: Answer: 2425 + Number of Bear + Number of Fox**<eos>
Define Fox as w; so w = 619. Define Bear as Y; k = w = 619; so Y = 258 + k = 258 + 619 = 877. Define Wolf as b; F = Y = 877; so b = 828 + F = 828 + 877 = 1705. Define Deer as o; A = b + w = 1705 + 619 = 2324; l = A + Y = 2324 + 877 = 3201; so o = 730 + l = 730 + 3201 = 3931. Answer: 3931.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals 730 plus the sum of the number of wolf, the number of fox, and the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals 828 plus the number of bear.
- the number of fox equals 619.
- the number of bear equals 258 plus the number of fox.

**calculation:**

- from the equation "the number of deer equals 730 plus the sum of the number of wolf, the number of fox, and the number of bear," we can get:
number of deer = 730 + number of wolf + number of fox + number of bear

- from the equation "the number of wolf equals 828 plus the number of bear," we can get:
number of wolf = 828 + number of bear

- from the equation "the number of bear equals 258 plus the number of fox," we can get:
number of bear = 258 + number of fox

- substitute the above two equations into the first equation, we get:
number of deer = 730 + (828 + number of bear) + 619 + (258 + number of fox)

- simplify the equation:
number of deer = 730 + 828 + number of bear + 619 + 258 + number of fox
number of deer = 2425 + number of bear + number of fox

**answer: answer: 2425 + number of bear + number of fox**<eos>

2. Calculate the number of Owl:
Number of Owl = 697 + number of Blue Jay + number of Eagle + number of Parrot
Number of Owl = 697 + 1156 + 188 + 859
**Answer: Number of Owl = 3690**<eos>
Define Eagle as z; so z = 188. Define Parrot as V; I = z = 188; so V = 859 + I = 859 + 188 = 1047. Define Blue Jay as h; C = V = 1047; so h = 297 + C = 297 + 1047 = 1344. Define Owl as c; v = h + z = 1344 + 188 = 1532; F = v + V = 1532 + 1047 = 2579; so c = 697 + F = 697 + 2579 = 3276. Answer: 3276.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals 697 plus the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of eagle, and the number of parrot.
- the number of blue jay equals 297 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of eagle equals 188.
- the number of parrot equals 859 plus the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

1. calculate the number of blue jay:
number of blue jay = 297 + number of parrot
number of blue jay = 297 + 859
number of blue jay = 1156

2. calculate the number of owl:
number of owl = 697 + number of blue jay + number of eagle + number of parrot
number of owl = 697 + 1156 + 188 + 859

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals 208.
- The number of Deer equals 183 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 488 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 484 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 769 plus the number of Raccoon.

**Calculation:**

- From the equation "The number of Fox equals 769 plus the number of Raccoon", we can get:
Number of Raccoon = Number of Fox - 769
Number of Raccoon = 769 - Number of Fox

- From the equation "The number of Deer equals 183 plus the number of Fox", we can get:
Number of Fox = Number of Deer - 183

- Substitute the above equation into the equation for Number of Raccoon, we get:
Number of Raccoon = 769 - (Number of Deer - 183)
Number of Raccoon = 769 - Number of Deer + 183
Number of Raccoon = 952 - Number of Deer

- From the equation "The number of Bear equals 488 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf", we can get:
Number of Wolf = (Number of Bear - 488) - Number of Deer

- Substitute the value of Number of Raccoon from above equation, we get:
Number of Wolf = (Number of Bear - 488) - (952 - Number of Deer)
Number of Wolf = Number of Bear - 488 - 952 + Number of Deer
Number of Wolf = Number of Bear - 1440 + Number of Deer

**Answer: The number of Wolf is Number of Bear - 1440 + Number of Deer.**<eos>
Define Raccoon as R; so R = 208. Define Fox as I; N = R = 208; so I = 769 + N = 769 + 208 = 977. Define Deer as E; W = I = 977; so E = 183 + W = 183 + 977 = 1160. Define Wolf as p; w = E + R = 1160 + 208 = 1368; B = w + I = 1368 + 977 = 2345; so p = 484 + B = 484 + 2345 = 2829. Answer: 2829.
**arguments:**

- the number of raccoon equals 208.
- the number of deer equals 183 plus the number of fox.
- the number of bear equals 488 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 484 plus the sum of the number of deer, the number of raccoon, and the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 769 plus the number of raccoon.

**calculation:**

- from the equation "the number of fox equals 769 plus the number of raccoon", we can get:
number of raccoon = number of fox - 769
number of raccoon = 769 - number of fox

- from the equation "the number of deer equals 183 plus the number of fox", we can get:
number of fox = number of deer - 183

- substitute the above equation into the equation for number of raccoon, we get:
number of raccoon = 769 - (number of deer - 183)
number of raccoon = 769 - number of deer + 183
number of raccoon = 952 - number of deer

- from the equation "the number of bear equals 488 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf", we can get:
number of wolf = (number of bear - 488) - number of deer

- substitute the value of number of raccoon from above equation, we get:
number of wolf = (number of bear - 488) - (952 - number of deer)
number of wolf = number of bear - 488 - 952 + number of deer
number of wolf = number of bear - 1440 + number of deer

**answer: the number of wolf is number of bear - 1440 + number of deer.**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 678 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 971 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 125.
- The number of Wolf equals 738 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Bear, and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Deer = 678 + 125 = 703.
- The number of Fox = 971 + 703 = 1674.
- The number of Wolf = 738 + (1674 + 125 + 703) = 3310.

**Answer: 3310**<eos>
Define Bear as z; so z = 125. Define Deer as v; Y = z = 125; so v = 678 + Y = 678 + 125 = 803. Define Fox as K; D = v = 803; so K = 971 + D = 971 + 803 = 1774. Define Wolf as i; d = K + z = 1774 + 125 = 1899; I = d + v = 1899 + 803 = 2702; so i = 738 + I = 738 + 2702 = 3440. Answer: 3440.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 709 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 924 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Fox, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 902.
- The number of Bear equals 58 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have the number of Bear equals 709 - the number of Deer.
- Substituting this expression for the number of Bear into the fourth equation, we get:
  Number of Bear = 58 + (902 - the number of Deer)
  Number of Bear = 58 + 902 - the number of Deer
  Number of Bear = 960 - the number of Deer
- Substituting the expression for the number of Bear into the second equation, we get:
  Number of Wolf = 924 + (709 - the number of Deer + 902 - the number of Bear)
  Number of Wolf = 924 + (709 - the number of Deer + 902 - (960 - the number of Deer))
  Number of Wolf = 924 + (709 + the number of Deer - 960 + the number of Deer)
  Number of Wolf = 924 + 2 the number of Deer - 251
  Number of Wolf = 673 + 2 the number of Deer
- Therefore, the number of Wolf is 673 plus twice the number of Deer.

**Answer: 673 + 2 * the number of Deer**<eos>
Define Fox as O; so O = 902. Define Bear as W; c = O = 902; so W = 58 + c = 58 + 902 = 960. Define Deer as z; S = W = 960; so z = 709 + S = 709 + 960 = 1669. Define Wolf as I; j = z + O = 1669 + 902 = 2571; C = j + W = 2571 + 960 = 3531; so I = 924 + C = 924 + 3531 = 4455. Answer: 4455.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals 709 plus the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals 924 plus the sum of the number of deer, the number of fox, and the number of bear.
- the number of fox equals 902.
- the number of bear equals 58 plus the number of fox.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have the number of bear equals 709 - the number of deer.
- substituting this expression for the number of bear into the fourth equation, we get:
  number of bear = 58 + (902 - the number of deer)
  number of bear = 58 + 902 - the number of deer
  number of bear = 960 - the number of deer
- substituting the expression for the number of bear into the second equation, we get:
  number of wolf = 924 + (709 - the number of deer + 902 - the number of bear)
  number of wolf = 924 + (709 - the number of deer + 902 - (960 - the number of deer))
  number of wolf = 924 + (709 + the number of deer - 960 + the number of deer)
  number of wolf = 924 + 2 the number of deer - 251
  number of wolf = 673 + 2 the number of deer
- therefore, the number of wolf is 673 plus twice the number of deer.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 473 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 617 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 552 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 498.

**Calculation:**

- From the equation: The number of Eagle equals 552 plus the number of Owl, we can get the number of Owl = The number of Eagle - 552 = 552 - 498 = 54.
- From the equation: The number of Blue Jay equals 617 plus the number of Eagle, we can get the number of Eagle = The number of Blue Jay - 617 = 617 - 552 = 65.
- From the equation: The number of Parrot equals 473 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle, we can get the number of Parrot = 473 + 617 + 54 + 65 = 1229.

**Answer: 1229**<eos>
Define Owl as y; so y = 498. Define Eagle as o; Z = y = 498; so o = 552 + Z = 552 + 498 = 1050. Define Blue Jay as n; H = o = 1050; so n = 617 + H = 617 + 1050 = 1667. Define Parrot as L; r = n + y = 1667 + 498 = 2165; m = r + o = 2165 + 1050 = 3215; so L = 473 + m = 473 + 3215 = 3688. Answer: 3688.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 473 plus the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of owl, and the number of eagle.
- the number of blue jay equals 617 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 552 plus the number of owl.
- the number of owl equals 498.

**calculation:**

- from the equation: the number of eagle equals 552 plus the number of owl, we can get the number of owl = the number of eagle - 552 = 552 - 498 = 54.
- from the equation: the number of blue jay equals 617 plus the number of eagle, we can get the number of eagle = the number of blue jay - 617 = 617 - 552 = 65.
- from the equation: the number of parrot equals 473 plus the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of owl, and the number of eagle, we can get the number of parrot = 473 + 617 + 54 + 65 = 1229.

- The number of Crow is 95 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot is 994 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Owl is 791 + (Parrot + Eagle) = 791 + (994 + 875) = 791 + 1869 = 2660.
- The number of Eagle is 875 + Blue Jay = 875 + 914 = 1789.
- The number of Crow is 95 + Owl = 95 + 2660 = 2755.

**Answer: 2755**<eos>
Define Eagle as k; X = None = 914; so k = 875 + X = 875 + 914 = 1789. Define Parrot as T; P = k = 1789; so T = 994 + P = 994 + 1789 = 2783. Define Owl as G; D = T + k = 2783 + 1789 = 4572; so G = 791 + D = 791 + 4572 = 5363. Define Crow as n; Z = G = 5363; so n = 95 + Z = 95 + 5363 = 5458. Answer: 5458.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay is 914.
- the number of owl is 791 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle is 875 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of crow is 95 plus the number of owl.
- the number of parrot is 994 plus the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 554 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 314 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 274 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Bear, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 864.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox is 554 + 864 = 1418.
- The number of Deer is 314 + 1418 = 1732.
- The number of Wolf is 274 + 1732 + 1418 = 3484.

**Answer: 3484**<eos>
Define Bear as f; so f = 864. Define Fox as A; H = f = 864; so A = 554 + H = 554 + 864 = 1418. Define Deer as j; y = A = 1418; so j = 314 + y = 314 + 1418 = 1732. Define Wolf as c; g = j + f = 1732 + 864 = 2596; w = g + A = 2596 + 1418 = 4014; so c = 274 + w = 274 + 4014 = 4288. Answer: 4288.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 370 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 880.
- The number of Parrot equals 856 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 684 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Owl, and the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have the number of Parrot = 370 - Eagle.
- From the third equation, we have the number of Owl = Parrot - 856.
- Substituting the above two equations into the second equation, we get:
  880 = Parrot - 856 - Eagle
  => Parrot = 880 + 856 - Eagle
  => Parrot = 1736 - Eagle
- Substituting the above equation into the first equation, we get:
  Eagle = 370 + (1736 - Eagle)
  => Eagle = 370 + 1736 - Eagle
  => 2*Eagle = 2106
  => Eagle = 1053
- Substituting the value of Eagle back into the equation for Parrot, we get:
  Parrot = 1736 - 1053
  => Parrot = 683
- Substituting the values of Eagle and Parrot back into the equation for Blue Jay, we get:
  Blue Jay = 684 + 1053 + 683
  => Blue Jay = 2410

**Answer: 2410**<eos>
Define Owl as K; so K = 880. Define Parrot as Q; I = K = 880; so Q = 856 + I = 856 + 880 = 1736. Define Eagle as D; z = Q = 1736; so D = 370 + z = 370 + 1736 = 2106. Define Blue Jay as J; u = D + K = 2106 + 880 = 2986; P = u + Q = 2986 + 1736 = 4722; so J = 684 + P = 684 + 4722 = 5406. Answer: 5406.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 370 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals 880.
- the number of parrot equals 856 plus the number of owl.
- the number of blue jay equals 684 plus the sum of the number of eagle, the number of owl, and the number of parrot.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have the number of parrot = 370 - eagle.
- from the third equation, we have the number of owl = parrot - 856.
- substituting the above two equations into the second equation, we get:
  880 = parrot - 856 - eagle
  => parrot = 880 + 856 - eagle
  => parrot = 1736 - eagle
- substituting the above equation into the first equation, we get:
  eagle = 370 + (1736 - eagle)
  => eagle = 370 + 1736 - eagle
  => 2*eagle = 2106
  => eagle = 1053
- substituting the value of eagle back into the equation for parrot, we get:
  parrot = 1736 - 1053
  => parrot = 683
- substituting the values of eagle and parrot back into the equation for blue jay, we get:
  blue jay = 684 + 1053 + 683
  => blue jay = 2410

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 20.
- The number of Crow equals 255 plus the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Owl, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 3.
- The number of Parrot equals 335 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 659 plus the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot = 335 + Blue Jay = 335 + (659 + Owl) = 335 + (659 + 3) = 335 + 662 = 997.
- The number of Crow = 255 + Parrot + Owl + Blue Jay = 255 + 997 + 3 + 659 = 255 + 1657 = 1912.

**Answer: 1912**<eos>
Define Owl as Y; so Y = 3. Define Blue Jay as P; W = Y = 3; so P = 659 + W = 659 + 3 = 662. Define Parrot as s; t = P = 662; so s = 335 + t = 335 + 662 = 997. Define Crow as L; S = s + Y = 997 + 3 = 1000; u = S + P = 1000 + 662 = 1662; so L = 255 + u = 255 + 1662 = 1917. Answer: 1917.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 466 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals 265.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 84 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 418 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Parrot, and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay is 84 plus the number of Parrot, so the number of Blue Jay is 84 + 265 = 349.
- The number of Eagle is 466 minus the number of Blue Jay, so the number of Eagle is 466 - 349 = 117.
- The sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Parrot, and the number of Blue Jay is 117 + 265 + 349 = 731.
- The number of Owl is 418 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Parrot, and the number of Blue Jay, so the number of Owl is 418 + 731 = 1149.

**Answer: 1149**<eos>
Define Parrot as U; so U = 265. Define Blue Jay as c; s = U = 265; so c = 84 + s = 84 + 265 = 349. Define Eagle as x; d = c = 349; so x = 466 + d = 466 + 349 = 815. Define Owl as I; C = x + U = 815 + 265 = 1080; B = C + c = 1080 + 349 = 1429; so I = 418 + B = 418 + 1429 = 1847. Answer: 1847.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 626 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 253 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Deer, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 833 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 257.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have the number of Fox = 626 - Wolf.
- From the third equation, we have the number of Deer = 833 - Fox.
- Substituting the above equation into the second equation, we get:
Number of Bear = 253 + (626 - Wolf) + 257 + Fox
= 500 + Wolf + Fox
- From the first equation, we have Wolf = Fox - 626.
- Substituting this into the above equation, we get:
Number of Bear = 500 + (Fox - 626) + Fox
= 500 - 626 + 2Fox
= 2Fox - 126

**Answer: Answer: 2Fox - 126**<eos>
Define Deer as U; so U = 257. Define Fox as B; o = U = 257; so B = 833 + o = 833 + 257 = 1090. Define Wolf as Q; E = B = 1090; so Q = 626 + E = 626 + 1090 = 1716. Define Bear as l; H = Q + U = 1716 + 257 = 1973; G = H + B = 1973 + 1090 = 3063; so l = 253 + G = 253 + 3063 = 3316. Answer: 3316.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 626 plus the number of fox.
- the number of bear equals 253 plus the sum of the number of wolf, the number of deer, and the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 833 plus the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 257.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have the number of fox = 626 - wolf.
- from the third equation, we have the number of deer = 833 - fox.
- substituting the above equation into the second equation, we get:
number of bear = 253 + (626 - wolf) + 257 + fox
= 500 + wolf + fox
- from the first equation, we have wolf = fox - 626.
- substituting this into the above equation, we get:
number of bear = 500 + (fox - 626) + fox
= 500 - 626 + 2fox
= 2fox - 126

**answer: answer: 2fox - 126**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 912 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 830.
- The number of Wolf equals 586 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 589 plus the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf is 586 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox is 830, so the number of Wolf is 586 + 830 = 1416.
- The number of Bear is 912 plus the number of Wolf, so the number of Bear is 912 + 1416 = 2328.
- The sum of the number of Bear, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf is 2328 + 830 + 1416 = 4574.
- The number of Deer is 589 plus the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf, so the number of Deer is 589 + 4574 = 5163.

**Answer: 5163**<eos>
Define Fox as T; so T = 830. Define Wolf as i; L = T = 830; so i = 586 + L = 586 + 830 = 1416. Define Bear as Z; N = i = 1416; so Z = 912 + N = 912 + 1416 = 2328. Define Deer as z; r = Z + T = 2328 + 830 = 3158; C = r + i = 3158 + 1416 = 4574; so z = 589 + C = 589 + 4574 = 5163. Answer: 5163.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 912 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of fox equals 830.
- the number of wolf equals 586 plus the number of fox.
- the number of deer equals 589 plus the sum of the number of bear, the number of fox, and the number of wolf.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 739 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Deer, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 876 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 653.
- The number of Wolf equals 615 plus the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox equals 739 + (Wolf + Deer + Bear).
- The number of Bear equals 876 + Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 615 + Bear.
- Substituting the above equations, we get:
  - The number of Fox equals 739 + (615 + Bear + 876 + Deer)
  - The number of Fox equals 739 + 1491 + Deer
  - The number of Fox equals 2230 + Deer

**Answer: 2230 + Deer**<eos>
Define Deer as c; so c = 653. Define Bear as D; a = c = 653; so D = 876 + a = 876 + 653 = 1529. Define Wolf as l; w = D = 1529; so l = 615 + w = 615 + 1529 = 2144. Define Fox as t; B = l + c = 2144 + 653 = 2797; r = B + D = 2797 + 1529 = 4326; so t = 739 + r = 739 + 4326 = 5065. Answer: 5065.

Define Blue Jay as P; so P = 7. Define Eagle as L; G = P = 7; so L = 29 + G = 29 + 7 = 36. Define Parrot as r; R = L = 36; so r = 948 + R = 948 + 36 = 984. Define Owl as K; x = r + P = 984 + 7 = 991; m = x + L = 991 + 36 = 1027; so K = 592 + m = 592 + 1027 = 1619. Answer: 1619.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay is 7.
- the number of parrot is 948 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle is 29 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl is 592 plus the sum of the number of parrot, the number of blue jay, and the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- the number of eagle is 29 + 7 = 36.
- the number of parrot is 948 + 36 = 984.
- the sum of the number of parrot, the number of blue jay, and the number of eagle is 984 + 7 + 36 = 1026.
- the number of owl is 592 + 1026 = 1618.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 276 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Bear, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 55.
- The number of Fox equals 460 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 553 plus the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox equals 460 plus the number of Wolf, so the number of Wolf equals the number of Fox - 460.
- The number of Deer equals 276 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Bear, and the number of Wolf, so the number of Deer equals 276 + (the number of Fox) + (the number of Bear) + (the number of Wolf).
- The number of Bear equals 55.
- The number of Wolf equals 553 plus the number of Bear, so the number of Wolf equals 553 + 55 = 608.
- The number of Fox equals 460 plus the number of Wolf, so the number of Fox equals 460 + 608 = 1068.
- The number of Deer equals 276 + 1068 + 55 = 1399.

**Answer: 1399**<eos>
Define Bear as k; so k = 55. Define Wolf as e; B = k = 55; so e = 553 + B = 553 + 55 = 608. Define Fox as D; A = e = 608; so D = 460 + A = 460 + 608 = 1068. Define Deer as q; W = D + k = 1068 + 55 = 1123; X = W + e = 1123 + 608 = 1731; so q = 276 + X = 276 + 1731 = 2007. Answer: 2007.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals 276 plus the sum of the number of fox, the number of bear, and the number of wolf.
- the number of bear equals 55.
- the number of fox equals 460 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 553 plus the number of bear.

**calculation:**

- the number of fox equals 460 plus the number of wolf, so the number of wolf equals the number of fox - 460.
- the number of deer equals 276 plus the sum of the number of fox, the number of bear, and the number of wolf, so the number of deer equals 276 + (the number of fox) + (the number of bear) + (the number of wolf).
- the number of bear equals 55.
- the number of wolf equals 553 plus the number of bear, so the number of wolf equals 553 + 55 = 608.
- the number of fox equals 460 plus the number of wolf, so the number of fox equals 460 + 608 = 1068.
- the number of deer equals 276 + 1068 + 55 = 1399.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 214 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 964 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 258.
- The number of Bear equals 380 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Bear as:
Number of Bear = 380 + 258 = 638
- We can then calculate the number of Fox as:
Number of Fox = 964 + 638 = 1502
- Finally, we can calculate the number of Deer as:
Number of Deer = 214 + 1502 + 258 = 2074

**Answer: 2074**<eos>
Define Wolf as z; so z = 258. Define Bear as E; v = z = 258; so E = 380 + v = 380 + 258 = 638. Define Fox as P; R = E = 638; so P = 964 + R = 964 + 638 = 1602. Define Deer as j; h = P + z = 1602 + 258 = 1860; m = h + E = 1860 + 638 = 2498; so j = 214 + m = 214 + 2498 = 2712. Answer: 2712.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 56 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 412.
- The number of Eagle equals 77 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 611.
- The number of Parrot equals 151 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot is 151 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Crow is 56 plus the number of Parrot, so the number of Crow is 56 + (151 + the number of Blue Jay).
- The number of Eagle is 77 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Parrot.
- Therefore, the number of Eagle is 77 + (56 + (151 + the number of Blue Jay)) + (412 + the number of Blue Jay).

**Answer:**

Answer: 77 + (56 + (151 + 412)) + 412 = 1452<eos>
Define Blue Jay as g; so g = 412. Define Parrot as z; h = g = 412; so z = 151 + h = 151 + 412 = 563. Define Crow as U; K = z = 563; so U = 56 + K = 56 + 563 = 619. Define Eagle as a; n = U + g = 619 + 412 = 1031; o = n + z = 1031 + 563 = 1594; so a = 77 + o = 77 + 1594 = 1671. Answer: 1671.
**arguments:**

- the number of crow equals 56 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of blue jay equals 412.
- the number of eagle equals 77 plus the sum of the number of crow, the number of blue jay, and the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals 611.
- the number of parrot equals 151 plus the number of blue jay.

**calculation:**

- the number of parrot is 151 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of crow is 56 plus the number of parrot, so the number of crow is 56 + (151 + the number of blue jay).
- the number of eagle is 77 plus the sum of the number of crow, the number of blue jay, and the number of parrot.
- therefore, the number of eagle is 77 + (56 + (151 + the number of blue jay)) + (412 + the number of blue jay).

**answer:**

answer: 77 + (56 + (151 + 412)) + 412 = 1452<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 643 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals 956 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 515.
- The number of Raccoon equals 368 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 123 plus the number of Raccoon.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox = 643 + (Wolf + Raccoon) = 643 + (123 + Raccoon) = 643 + 123 + Raccoon = 766 + Raccoon.
- The number of Deer = 956 + Fox = 956 + (766 + Raccoon) = 956 + 766 + Raccoon = 1722 + Raccoon.
- Therefore, the number of Deer is 1722 + Raccoon.

**Answer: 1722 + Raccoon**<eos>
Define Raccoon as M; H = None = 515; so M = 368 + H = 368 + 515 = 883. Define Wolf as u; K = M = 883; so u = 123 + K = 123 + 883 = 1006. Define Fox as j; Y = u + M = 1006 + 883 = 1889; so j = 643 + Y = 643 + 1889 = 2532. Define Deer as N; i = j = 2532; so N = 956 + i = 956 + 2532 = 3488. Answer: 3488.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals 643 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of raccoon.
- the number of deer equals 956 plus the number of fox.
- the number of bear equals 515.
- the number of raccoon equals 368 plus the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals 123 plus the number of raccoon.

**calculation:**

- the number of fox = 643 + (wolf + raccoon) = 643 + (123 + raccoon) = 643 + 123 + raccoon = 766 + raccoon.
- the number of deer = 956 + fox = 956 + (766 + raccoon) = 956 + 766 + raccoon = 1722 + raccoon.
- therefore, the number of deer is 1722 + raccoon.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 882 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 960 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 541 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 11.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle as follows:
Number of Eagle = 960 + 11 = 971
- We can then calculate the number of Blue Jay as follows:
Number of Blue Jay = 541 + 971 = 1512
- Finally, we can calculate the number of Parrot as follows:
Number of Parrot = 882 + 1512 + 11 = 2405

**Answer: 2405**<eos>
Define Owl as E; so E = 11. Define Eagle as x; L = E = 11; so x = 960 + L = 960 + 11 = 971. Define Blue Jay as o; f = x = 971; so o = 541 + f = 541 + 971 = 1512. Define Parrot as B; K = o + E = 1512 + 11 = 1523; n = K + x = 1523 + 971 = 2494; so B = 882 + n = 882 + 2494 = 3376. Answer: 3376.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 890 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals 802 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 530 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Deer, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 393.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear = 890 + 393 = 1283.
- The number of Fox = 802 + 1283 = 1985.
- The number of Wolf = 530 + 1985 + 393 = 2912.

**Answer: 2912**<eos>
Define Deer as p; so p = 393. Define Bear as m; D = p = 393; so m = 890 + D = 890 + 393 = 1283. Define Fox as o; t = m = 1283; so o = 802 + t = 802 + 1283 = 2085. Define Wolf as C; y = o + p = 2085 + 393 = 2478; a = y + m = 2478 + 1283 = 3761; so C = 530 + a = 530 + 3761 = 4291. Answer: 4291.

- The number of Owl equals 302 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 716.
- The number of Eagle equals 851 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle as follows:
Number of Eagle = 851 + Number of Blue Jay
- We can substitute the value of Number of Blue Jay to get:
Number of Eagle = 851 + 716 = 1567
- We can calculate the number of Owl as follows:
Number of Owl = 302 + Number of Eagle
- We can substitute the value of Number of Eagle to get:
Number of Owl = 302 + 1567 = 1869
- We can calculate the number of Parrot as follows:
Number of Parrot = 2 + Number of Owl + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Eagle
- We can substitute the values of Number of Owl, Number of Blue Jay, and Number of Eagle to get:
Number of Parrot = 2 + 1869 + 716 + 1567 = 4113

**Answer: 4113**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as c; so c = 716. Define Eagle as e; o = c = 716; so e = 851 + o = 851 + 716 = 1567. Define Owl as O; A = e = 1567; so O = 302 + A = 302 + 1567 = 1869. Define Parrot as v; V = O + c = 1869 + 716 = 2585; I = V + e = 2585 + 1567 = 4152; so v = 2 + I = 2 + 4152 = 4154. Answer: 4154.

- The number of Bear equals 972.
- The number of Fox equals 274 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 158 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear is 972.
- The number of Fox is 274 plus the number of Bear, so the number of Fox is 274 + 972 = 1246.
- The number of Deer is 158 plus the number of Fox, so the number of Deer is 158 + 1246 = 1404.
- The number of Wolf is 859 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Bear, and the number of Fox, so the number of Wolf is 859 + 1404 + 972 = 3235.

**Answer: 3235**<eos>
Define Bear as o; so o = 972. Define Fox as n; i = o = 972; so n = 274 + i = 274 + 972 = 1246. Define Deer as c; L = n = 1246; so c = 158 + L = 158 + 1246 = 1404. Define Wolf as R; F = c + o = 1404 + 972 = 2376; f = F + n = 2376 + 1246 = 3622; so R = 859 + f = 859 + 3622 = 4481. Answer: 4481.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 995 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 200.
- The number of Owl equals 973 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals 39 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Parrot, and the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Owl is 973 plus the number of Parrot, so the number of Owl is 973 + 200 = 1173.
- The number of Blue Jay is 995 plus the number of Owl, so the number of Blue Jay is 995 + 1173 = 1968.
- The sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Parrot, and the number of Owl is 1968 + 200 + 1173 = 3341.
- The number of Eagle is 39 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Parrot, and the number of Owl, so the number of Eagle is 39 + 3341 = 3380.

**Answer: 3380**<eos>
Define Parrot as L; so L = 200. Define Owl as h; t = L = 200; so h = 973 + t = 973 + 200 = 1173. Define Blue Jay as a; q = h = 1173; so a = 995 + q = 995 + 1173 = 2168. Define Eagle as Q; N = a + L = 2168 + 200 = 2368; m = N + h = 2368 + 1173 = 3541; so Q = 39 + m = 39 + 3541 = 3580. Answer: 3580.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 108 plus the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Eagle, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals 131 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals 437.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 774 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 290 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Parrot, and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

1. From the equation "The number of Parrot equals 131 plus the number of Blue Jay", we can calculate the number of Blue Jay:
Number of Blue Jay = Number of Parrot - 131
Number of Blue Jay = 774 - 131
Number of Blue Jay = 643

2. From the equation "The number of Blue Jay equals 774 plus the number of Eagle", we can calculate the number of Eagle:
Number of Eagle = Number of Blue Jay - 774
Number of Eagle = 643 - 774
Number of Eagle = -131 (This means there are no Eagles in this location)

3. From the equation "The number of Crow equals 108 plus the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Eagle, and the number of Blue Jay", we can calculate the number of Crow:
Number of Crow = 108 + Number of Parrot + Number of Eagle + Number of Blue Jay
Number of Crow = 108 + 131 - 131 + 643
Number of Crow = 108 + 643
**Answer: 751**<eos>
Define Eagle as R; so R = 437. Define Blue Jay as r; I = R = 437; so r = 774 + I = 774 + 437 = 1211. Define Parrot as B; Y = r = 1211; so B = 131 + Y = 131 + 1211 = 1342. Define Crow as k; S = B + R = 1342 + 437 = 1779; f = S + r = 1779 + 1211 = 2990; so k = 108 + f = 108 + 2990 = 3098. Answer: 3098.
**arguments:**

- the number of crow equals 108 plus the sum of the number of parrot, the number of eagle, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of parrot equals 131 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of eagle equals 437.
- the number of blue jay equals 774 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals 290 plus the sum of the number of eagle, the number of parrot, and the number of blue jay.

**calculation:**

1. from the equation "the number of parrot equals 131 plus the number of blue jay", we can calculate the number of blue jay:
number of blue jay = number of parrot - 131
number of blue jay = 774 - 131
number of blue jay = 643

2. from the equation "the number of blue jay equals 774 plus the number of eagle", we can calculate the number of eagle:
number of eagle = number of blue jay - 774
number of eagle = 643 - 774
number of eagle = -131 (this means there are no eagles in this location)

3. from the equation "the number of crow equals 108 plus the sum of the number of parrot, the number of eagle, and the number of blue jay", we can calculate the number of crow:
number of crow = 108 + number of parrot + number of eagle + number of blue jay
number of crow = 108 + 131 - 131 + 643
number of crow = 108 + 643

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 232 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 280.
- The number of Wolf equals 395 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 136 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Deer, and the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf is 395 + 512 = 907.
- The sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Deer, and the number of Fox is 907 + 280 + 512 = 1699.
- The number of Bear is 136 + 1699 = 1835.

**Answer: 1835**<eos>
Define Deer as H; so H = 280. Define Fox as q; n = H = 280; so q = 232 + n = 232 + 280 = 512. Define Wolf as v; E = q = 512; so v = 395 + E = 395 + 512 = 907. Define Bear as G; X = v + H = 907 + 280 = 1187; Q = X + q = 1187 + 512 = 1699; so G = 136 + Q = 136 + 1699 = 1835. Answer: 1835.

- The number of Blue Jay equals 693.
- The number of Owl equals 386 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals 228 plus the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay is 693.
- The number of Owl is 386 plus the number of Blue Jay, so the number of Owl is 386 + 693 = 1079.
- The number of Parrot is 228 plus the number of Owl, so the number of Parrot is 228 + 1079 = 1307.
- The number of Eagle is 283 plus the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Owl, so the number of Eagle is 283 + 1307 + 693 = 2683.

**Answer: 2683**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as j; so j = 693. Define Owl as i; X = j = 693; so i = 386 + X = 386 + 693 = 1079. Define Parrot as G; p = i = 1079; so G = 228 + p = 228 + 1079 = 1307. Define Eagle as c; t = G + j = 1307 + 693 = 2000; V = t + i = 2000 + 1079 = 3079; so c = 283 + V = 283 + 3079 = 3362. Answer: 3362.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 768 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 311 plus the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Wolf, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals 641 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Wolf equals 465.
- The number of Raccoon equals 940 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have:
Number of Fox = Number of Deer - 768
- From the second equation, we have:
Number of Fox = 311 + (Number of Bear + Number of Wolf + Number of Raccoon)
- From the third and fourth equations, we have:
Number of Bear = 641 + Number of Raccoon
Number of Raccoon = 940 + Number of Wolf
- Substitute the third and fourth equations into the second equation:
Number of Fox = 311 + (641 + Number of Raccoon + Number of Wolf + Number of Raccoon)
- Combine like terms:
Number of Fox = 952 + 2 * Number of Raccoon + Number of Wolf
- From the fifth equation, we have:
Number of Fox = 952 + 2 * (940 + Number of Wolf) + Number of Wolf
- Simplify:
Number of Fox = 952 + 1880 + 3 * Number of Wolf
- Therefore, the number of Fox is 2832 + 3 * Number of Wolf.

**Answer: 2832 + 3 * Number of Wolf**<eos>
Define Wolf as k; so k = 465. Define Raccoon as O; Y = k = 465; so O = 940 + Y = 940 + 465 = 1405. Define Bear as V; p = O = 1405; so V = 641 + p = 641 + 1405 = 2046. Define Fox as M; c = V + k = 2046 + 465 = 2511; Z = c + O = 2511 + 1405 = 3916; so M = 311 + Z = 311 + 3916 = 4227. Answer: 4227.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals 768 plus the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 311 plus the sum of the number of bear, the number of wolf, and the number of raccoon.
- the number of bear equals 641 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of wolf equals 465.
- the number of raccoon equals 940 plus the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have:
number of fox = number of deer - 768
- from the second equation, we have:
number of fox = 311 + (number of bear + number of wolf + number of raccoon)
- from the third and fourth equations, we have:
number of bear = 641 + number of raccoon
number of raccoon = 940 + number of wolf
- substitute the third and fourth equations into the second equation:
number of fox = 311 + (641 + number of raccoon + number of wolf + number of raccoon)
- combine like terms:
number of fox = 952 + 2 * number of raccoon + number of wolf
- from the fifth equation, we have:
number of fox = 952 + 2 * (940 + number of wolf) + number of wolf
- simplify:
number of fox = 952 + 1880 + 3 * number of wolf
- therefore, the number of fox is 2832 + 3 * number of wolf.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 818 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals 103 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 800 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 407 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 304 plus the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the equation "The number of Parrot equals 818 plus the number of Blue Jay", we have:
Number of Parrot = 818 + Number of Blue Jay
- From the equation "The number of Blue Jay equals 800 plus the number of Crow", we have:
Number of Blue Jay = 800 + Number of Crow
- From the equation "The number of Crow equals 407 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Parrot", we have:
Number of Crow = 407 + Number of Owl + Number of Parrot
- Substitute the above equations into the equation "The number of Eagle equals 103 plus the number of Crow", we get:
Number of Eagle = 103 + (407 + Number of Owl + Number of Parrot)
- Rearrange the equation to get:
Number of Eagle = 103 + 407 + Number of Owl + Number of Parrot
- Combine like terms:
Number of Eagle = 510 + Number of Owl + Number of Parrot
- From the equation "The number of Owl equals 304 plus the number of Parrot", we have:
Number of Owl = 304 + Number of Parrot
- Substitute the above equation into the equation for Number of Eagle:
Number of Eagle = 510 + (304 + Number of Parrot) + Number of Parrot
- Combine like terms:
Number of Eagle = 814 + 2 * Number of Parrot

**Answer: Answer: 814 + 2 * Number of Parrot**<eos>
Define Parrot as f; A = None = 800; so f = 818 + A = 818 + 800 = 1618. Define Owl as T; d = f = 1618; so T = 304 + d = 304 + 1618 = 1922. Define Crow as p; g = T + f = 1922 + 1618 = 3540; so p = 407 + g = 407 + 3540 = 3947. Define Eagle as Q; r = p = 3947; so Q = 103 + r = 103 + 3947 = 4050. Answer: 4050.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 818 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of eagle equals 103 plus the number of crow.
- the number of blue jay equals 800 plus the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals 407 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals 304 plus the number of parrot.

**calculation:**

- from the equation "the number of parrot equals 818 plus the number of blue jay", we have:
number of parrot = 818 + number of blue jay
- from the equation "the number of blue jay equals 800 plus the number of crow", we have:
number of blue jay = 800 + number of crow
- from the equation "the number of crow equals 407 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of parrot", we have:
number of crow = 407 + number of owl + number of parrot
- substitute the above equations into the equation "the number of eagle equals 103 plus the number of crow", we get:
number of eagle = 103 + (407 + number of owl + number of parrot)
- rearrange the equation to get:
number of eagle = 103 + 407 + number of owl + number of parrot
- combine like terms:
number of eagle = 510 + number of owl + number of parrot
- from the equation "the number of owl equals 304 plus the number of parrot", we have:
number of owl = 304 + number of parrot
- substitute the above equation into the equation for number of eagle:
number of eagle = 510 + (304 + number of parrot) + number of parrot
- combine like terms:
number of eagle = 814 + 2 * number of parrot

**answer: answer: 814 + 2 * number of parrot**<eos>

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated. Problem: The number of Bear equals 401 plus the number of Fox. The number of Fox equals 874.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 401 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 874.
- The number of Wolf equals 66 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 256 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Fox, and the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear is 401 + 874 = 1275.
- The number of Wolf is 66 + 1275 = 1341.
- The sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Fox, and the number of Bear is 1341 + 874 + 1275 = 3590.
- The number of Deer is 256 + 3590 = 3846.

**Answer: 3846**<eos>
Define Fox as Y; so Y = 874. Define Bear as T; K = Y = 874; so T = 401 + K = 401 + 874 = 1275. Define Wolf as X; q = T = 1275; so X = 66 + q = 66 + 1275 = 1341. Define Deer as j; c = X + Y = 1341 + 874 = 2215; i = c + T = 2215 + 1275 = 3490; so j = 256 + i = 256 + 3490 = 3746. Answer: 3746.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 242 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 545 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 607.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay is 607.
- The number of Sparrow is 242 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Blue Jay.
- Therefore, the number of Owl is 545 plus the number of Eagle, which is 607.
- The number of Sparrow is 242 plus 545 = 787.
- The number of Crow is equal to the number of Sparrow, which is 787.

**Answer: 787**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as O; so O = 607. Define Parrot as F; U = O = 607; so F = 82 + U = 82 + 607 = 689. Define Eagle as R; v = F + O = 689 + 607 = 1296; so R = 200 + v = 200 + 1296 = 1496. Define Owl as W; G = R = 1496; so W = 545 + G = 545 + 1496 = 2041. Define Sparrow as t; X = W + O = 2041 + 607 = 2648; so t = 242 + X = 242 + 2648 = 2890. Define Crow as K; so K = t = 2890. Answer: 2890.
**arguments:**

- the number of crow equals the number of sparrow.
- the number of sparrow equals 242 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals 545 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of blue jay equals 607.

**calculation:**

- the number of blue jay is 607.
- the number of sparrow is 242 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of blue jay.
- therefore, the number of owl is 545 plus the number of eagle, which is 607.
- the number of sparrow is 242 plus 545 = 787.
- the number of crow is equal to the number of sparrow, which is 787.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Fox, the number of Elephant, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Fox equals 889 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals 945.
- The number of Raccoon equals 676 plus the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon equals 676 + 945 = 1621.
- The number of Fox equals 889 + 1621 = 2510.
- The number of Wolf equals Deer + Fox + Elephant + Raccoon = x + 2510 + 945 + 1621 = x + 5076.
- The number of Bear equals Wolf = x + 5076.

**Answer: Answer: x + 5076**<eos>
Define Elephant as n; so n = 945. Define Raccoon as t; Y = n = 945; so t = 676 + Y = 676 + 945 = 1621. Define Fox as F; Z = t = 1621; so F = 889 + Z = 889 + 1621 = 2510. Define Deer as e; so e = F = 2510. Define Wolf as X; Q = e + F = 2510 + 2510 = 5020; k = Q + n = 5020 + 945 = 5965; so X = k + t = 5965 + 1621 = 7586. Define Bear as M; so M = X + F = 7586 + 2510 = 10096. Answer: 10096.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals the sum of the number of wolf and the number of fox.
- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of deer, the number of fox, the number of elephant, and the number of raccoon.
- the number of fox equals 889 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of elephant equals 945.
- the number of raccoon equals 676 plus the number of elephant.

**calculation:**

- the number of raccoon equals 676 + 945 = 1621.
- the number of fox equals 889 + 1621 = 2510.
- the number of wolf equals deer + fox + elephant + raccoon = x + 2510 + 945 + 1621 = x + 5076.
- the number of bear equals wolf = x + 5076.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox is 693.
- The number of Bear is 507 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Fox, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer is 503 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon is 974 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf is 16 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon is: 974 + 693 = 1667.
- The number of Deer is: 503 + 693 = 1196.
- The number of Bear is: 507 + 1667 + 1196 = 2960.
- The number of Wolf is: 16 + 2960 + 1196 = 4352.

**Answer: 4352**<eos>
Define Fox as n; so n = 693. Define Deer as G; A = n = 693; so G = 503 + A = 503 + 693 = 1196. Define Raccoon as R; h = G + n = 1196 + 693 = 1889; so R = 974 + h = 974 + 1889 = 2863. Define Bear as O; i = R + n = 2863 + 693 = 3556; e = i + G = 3556 + 1196 = 4752; so O = 507 + e = 507 + 4752 = 5259. Define Wolf as y; r = O + G = 5259 + 1196 = 6455; so y = 16 + r = 16 + 6455 = 6471. Answer: 6471.

- The number of Raccoon equals 86 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 334.
- The number of Lion equals 149.
- The number of Bear equals the number of Tiger.
- The number of Elephant equals 880 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Lion.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Horse.
- The number of Deer equals the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Horse = Bear + Tiger + Elephant = Bear + Bear + 880 + Lion
- The number of Raccoon = 86 + Wolf = 86 + (number of Horse)
- The number of Horse = Wolf = number of Horse
- The number of Bear = Tiger
- The number of Tiger = Elephant + Lion
- The number of Raccoon = 86 + (number of Horse) = 86 + (number of Horse)

**Answer: Answer: The number of Raccoon is 86 + (number of Horse)**<eos>
Define Lion as F; so F = 149. Define Elephant as k; S = F = 149; so k = 880 + S = 880 + 149 = 1029. Define Tiger as C; so C = k + F = 1029 + 149 = 1178. Define Bear as A; so A = C = 1178. Define Horse as H; h = A + C = 1178 + 1178 = 2356; so H = h + k = 2356 + 1029 = 3385. Define Wolf as G; so G = H = 3385. Define Raccoon as x; c = G = 3385; so x = 86 + c = 86 + 3385 = 3471. Answer: 3471.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Lion equals 608 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 784 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Bear.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Tiger.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger equals 393.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Tiger, so the number of Bear equals the sum of 0 and 393, which is 393.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Tiger, so the number of Elephant equals 393 + 393, which is 786.
- The number of Raccoon equals 784 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Bear, so the number of Raccoon equals 784 + 786, which is 1570.
- The number of Lion equals 608 plus the number of Raccoon, so the number of Lion equals 608 + 1570, which is 2178.

**Answer: 2178**<eos>
Define Tiger as v; so v = 393. Define Fox as B; j = v = 393; so B = 926 + j = 926 + 393 = 1319. Define Wolf as O; so O = B = 1319. Define Bear as R; so R = O + v = 1319 + 393 = 1712. Define Elephant as Y; so Y = R + v = 1712 + 393 = 2105. Define Raccoon as Q; I = Y + R = 2105 + 1712 = 3817; so Q = 784 + I = 784 + 3817 = 4601. Define Lion as U; M = Q = 4601; so U = 608 + M = 608 + 4601 = 5209. Answer: 5209.
**arguments:**

- the number of lion equals 608 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of raccoon equals 784 plus the sum of the number of elephant and the number of bear.
- the number of elephant equals the sum of the number of bear and the number of tiger.
- the number of bear equals the sum of the number of wolf and the number of tiger.

**calculation:**

- the number of tiger equals 393.
- the number of bear equals the sum of the number of wolf and the number of tiger, so the number of bear equals the sum of 0 and 393, which is 393.
- the number of elephant equals the sum of the number of bear and the number of tiger, so the number of elephant equals 393 + 393, which is 786.
- the number of raccoon equals 784 plus the sum of the number of elephant and the number of bear, so the number of raccoon equals 784 + 786, which is 1570.
- the number of lion equals 608 plus the number of raccoon, so the number of lion equals 608 + 1570, which is 2178.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 572 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 165 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals 984 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 958.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox is 572 + 165 = 737.
- The number of Deer is 165 + 958 = 1123.
- The number of Raccoon is 984 + 737 + 958 = 2689.
- The number of Bear is 2689 + 737 + 958 = 4384.

**Answer: 4384**<eos>
Define Wolf as L; so L = 958. Define Deer as n; Z = L = 958; so n = 165 + Z = 165 + 958 = 1123. Define Fox as j; B = n = 1123; so j = 572 + B = 572 + 1123 = 1695. Define Raccoon as S; P = j + L = 1695 + 958 = 2653; f = P + n = 2653 + 1123 = 3776; so S = 984 + f = 984 + 3776 = 4760. Define Bear as q; D = S + j = 4760 + 1695 = 6455; so q = D + L = 6455 + 958 = 7413. Answer: 7413.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 716 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 780 plus the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 690 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 878.
- The number of Parrot equals 261 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 780 + (690 + 261 + 878) = 2529.
- The number of Crow equals 716 + 2529 = 3245.

**Answer: 3245**<eos>
Define Eagle as i; so i = 878. Define Parrot as b; v = i = 878; so b = 261 + v = 261 + 878 = 1139. Define Owl as z; H = b + i = 1139 + 878 = 2017; so z = 690 + H = 690 + 2017 = 2707. Define Blue Jay as E; h = z + i = 2707 + 878 = 3585; w = h + b = 3585 + 1139 = 4724; so E = 780 + w = 780 + 4724 = 5504. Define Crow as e; I = E = 5504; so e = 716 + I = 716 + 5504 = 6220.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 661 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Deer equals 398.
- The number of Elephant equals the number of Horse.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Bear.
- The number of Horse equals 564 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Tiger equals 311 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Wolf, and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Wolf equals 63.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Elephant, and the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear = 661 + Fox + Tiger
- The number of Lion = Fox + Bear
- The number of Horse = 564 + Tiger + Wolf
- The number of Raccoon = Elephant + Wolf + Tiger
- The number of Fox = Raccoon + Elephant + Wolf

Substituting the values of Wolf (63) and Tiger (311) into the above equations, we get:

- The number of Bear = 661 + Fox + 311
- The number of Lion = Fox + 661
- The number of Horse = 564 + 311 + 63
- The number of Raccoon = Elephant + 63 + 311
- The number of Fox = Raccoon + Elephant + 63

Simplifying these equations, we get:

- The number of Bear = 972 + Fox
- The number of Lion = Fox + 661
- The number of Horse = 875
- The number of Raccoon = Elephant + 374
- The number of Fox = Raccoon + Elephant + 63

Substituting the value of Raccoon (Elephant + 374) into the equation for Fox, we get:

- The number of Fox = (Elephant + 374) + Elephant + 63

Simplifying further, we get:

- The number of Fox = 2 * Elephant + 437

**Answer: 2 * Elephant + 437**<eos>
Define Wolf as G; so G = 63. Define Tiger as A; b = G = 63; so A = 311 + b = 311 + 63 = 374. Define Horse as q; k = A + G = 374 + 63 = 437; so q = 564 + k = 564 + 437 = 1001. Define Elephant as r; so r = q = 1001. Define Raccoon as n; U = r + G = 1001 + 63 = 1064; so n = U + A = 1064 + 374 = 1438. Define Fox as C; z = n + r = 1438 + 1001 = 2439; so C = z + G = 2439 + 63 = 2502. Answer: 2502.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 661 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of tiger.
- the number of deer equals 398.
- the number of elephant equals the number of horse.
- the number of lion equals the sum of the number of fox and the number of bear.
- the number of horse equals 564 plus the sum of the number of tiger and the number of wolf.
- the number of tiger equals 311 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of elephant, the number of wolf, and the number of tiger.
- the number of wolf equals 63.
- the number of fox equals the sum of the number of raccoon, the number of elephant, and the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- the number of bear = 661 + fox + tiger
- the number of lion = fox + bear
- the number of horse = 564 + tiger + wolf
- the number of raccoon = elephant + wolf + tiger
- the number of fox = raccoon + elephant + wolf

substituting the values of wolf (63) and tiger (311) into the above equations, we get:

- the number of bear = 661 + fox + 311
- the number of lion = fox + 661
- the number of horse = 564 + 311 + 63
- the number of raccoon = elephant + 63 + 311
- the number of fox = raccoon + elephant + 63

simplifying these equations, we get:

- the number of bear = 972 + fox
- the number of lion = fox + 661
- the number of horse = 875
- the number of raccoon = elephant + 374
- the number of fox = raccoon + elephant + 63

substituting the value of raccoon (elephant + 374) into the equation for fox, we get:

- the number of fox = (elephant + 374) + elephant + 63

simplifying further, we get:

- the number of fox = 2 * elephant + 437

**answer: 2 * elephant + 437**<eos>

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated. Problem: The number of Blue Jay equals 805 plus the number of Eagle.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 703 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals 894 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 441 plus the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 401.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear = Raccoon + Fox + Wolf = 894 + 703 + 401 = 1998.
- The number of Raccoon = 894 + Fox = 894 + 703 = 1597.
- The number of Fox = 703.
- The number of Wolf = 401.
- The number of Deer = 441 + Bear + Raccoon + Wolf = 441 + 1998 + 1597 + 401 = 4497.

**Answer: 4497**<eos>
Define Wolf as C; so C = 401. Define Fox as S; Z = C = 401; so S = 703 + Z = 703 + 401 = 1104. Define Raccoon as V; D = S = 1104; so V = 894 + D = 894 + 1104 = 1998. Define Bear as F; P = V + S = 1998 + 1104 = 3102; so F = P + C = 3102 + 401 = 3503. Define Deer as b; t = F + V = 3503 + 1998 = 5501; a = t + C = 5501 + 401 = 5902; so b = 441 + a = 441 + 5902 = 6343. Answer: 6343.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 592 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Sparrow equals 55 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Eagle equals 659 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 265.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Crow = 592 + (Eagle + Parrot)
- The number of Blue Jay = Sparrow + Parrot
- The number of Owl = Parrot
- The number of Hawk = Blue Jay
- The number of Sparrow = 55 + Crow
- The number of Eagle = 659 + Owl
- The number of Parrot = 265

Substituting the number of Parrot into the above equations, we get:

- The number of Crow = 592 + (Eagle + 265)
- The number of Blue Jay = Sparrow + 265
- The number of Owl = 265
- The number of Hawk = Blue Jay
- The number of Sparrow = 55 + 592 + (Eagle + 265)
- The number of Eagle = 659 + 265

Simplifying the equations, we get:

- The number of Crow = 857 + Eagle
- The number of Blue Jay = Sparrow + 265
- The number of Owl = 265
- The number of Hawk = Sparrow + 265
- The number of Sparrow = 647 + Eagle
- The number of Eagle = 924

Substituting the number of Eagle into the above equations, we get:

- The number of Crow = 857 + 924
- The number of Blue Jay = Sparrow + 265
- The number of Owl = 265
- The number of Hawk = Sparrow + 265
- The number of Sparrow = 647 + 924
- The number of Eagle = 924

Simplifying further, we get:

- The number of Crow = 1781
- The number of Blue Jay = Sparrow + 265
- The number of Owl = 265
- The number of Hawk = Sparrow + 265
- The number of Sparrow = 1211
- The number of Eagle = 924

Therefore, the number of Hawk is Sparrow + 265 = 1211 + 265 = **1476**.

**Answer: 1476**<eos>
Define Parrot as p; so p = 265. Define Owl as W; so W = p = 265. Define Eagle as D; k = W = 265; so D = 659 + k = 659 + 265 = 924. Define Crow as s; v = D + p = 924 + 265 = 1189; so s = 592 + v = 592 + 1189 = 1781. Define Sparrow as X; n = s = 1781; so X = 55 + n = 55 + 1781 = 1836. Define Blue Jay as E; so E = X + p = 1836 + 265 = 2101. Define Hawk as j; so j = E = 2101. Answer: 2101.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Tiger equals the number of Lion.
- The number of Elephant equals 129.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Raccoon, the number of Elephant, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 374.
- The number of Raccoon equals 711 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Deer equals the number of Fox. Let's assume both are x.
- The number of Tiger equals the number of Lion, which is x + y.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Raccoon, the number of Elephant, and the number of Deer. Therefore, x + y = Wolf + Raccoon + Elephant + x.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox. Therefore, Wolf = x + x = 2x.
- The number of Raccoon equals 711 plus the number of Elephant. Therefore, Raccoon = 711 + Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Elephant. Therefore, Fox = Raccoon + Elephant.

**Substituting the values we know:**

x + y = 2x + 711 + Elephant + x
y = Elephant + 711
Fox = Raccoon + Elephant
2x = Wolf

**Solving for the unknowns:**

y = Elephant + 711
Fox = 711 + Elephant
2x = Wolf

**Final Answer:**

Tiger = x + y = x + (Elephant + 711)<eos>
Define Elephant as d; so d = 129. Define Raccoon as j; U = d = 129; so j = 711 + U = 711 + 129 = 840. Define Fox as W; so W = j + d = 840 + 129 = 969. Define Deer as s; so s = W = 969. Define Wolf as k; so k = s + W = 969 + 969 = 1938. Define Lion as L; f = k + j = 1938 + 840 = 2778; Y = f + d = 2778 + 129 = 2907; so L = Y + s = 2907 + 969 = 3876. Define Tiger as a; so a = L = 3876. Answer: 3876.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the number of fox.
- the number of tiger equals the number of lion.
- the number of elephant equals 129.
- the number of lion equals the sum of the number of wolf, the number of raccoon, the number of elephant, and the number of deer.
- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of deer and the number of fox.
- the number of bear equals 374.
- the number of raccoon equals 711 plus the number of elephant.
- the number of fox equals the sum of the number of raccoon and the number of elephant.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we know that the number of deer equals the number of fox. let's assume both are x.
- the number of tiger equals the number of lion, which is x + y.
- the number of lion equals the sum of the number of wolf, the number of raccoon, the number of elephant, and the number of deer. therefore, x + y = wolf + raccoon + elephant + x.
- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of deer and the number of fox. therefore, wolf = x + x = 2x.
- the number of raccoon equals 711 plus the number of elephant. therefore, raccoon = 711 + elephant.
- the number of fox equals the sum of the number of raccoon and the number of elephant. therefore, fox = raccoon + elephant.

**substituting the values we know:**

x + y = 2x + 711 + elephant + x
y = elephant + 711
fox = raccoon + elephant
2x = wolf

**solving for the unknowns:**

y = elephant + 711
fox = 711 + elephant
2x = wolf

**final answer:**

tiger = x + y = x + (elephant + 711)<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals 146 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Bear equals 330 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 212.
- The number of Deer equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals 665 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Bear, and the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf is 146 + 665 + 212 = 1023.
- The number of Bear is 330 + 212 = 542.
- The number of Deer is the same as the number of Wolf, which is 1023.

**Answer: 1023**<eos>
Define Fox as P; so P = 212. Define Bear as D; j = P = 212; so D = 330 + j = 330 + 212 = 542. Define Elephant as K; q = D + P = 542 + 212 = 754; so K = 665 + q = 665 + 754 = 1419. Define Raccoon as V; u = K = 1419; so V = 146 + u = 146 + 1419 = 1565. Define Wolf as x; H = V + D = 1565 + 542 = 2107; so x = H + P = 2107 + 212 = 2319. Define Deer as p; so p = x = 2319. Answer: 2319.

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals 372.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 906 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Raccoon equals 70 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear = The number of Wolf + The number of Elephant = 0 + 372 = 372
- The number of Fox = 917 + 372 = 1289
- The number of Deer = 906 + 372 = 1278
- The number of Wolf = The number of Deer = 1278
- The number of Raccoon = 70 + 1289 + 1278 = 3245

**Answer: 3245**<eos>
Define Elephant as w; so w = 372. Define Deer as I; p = w = 372; so I = 906 + p = 906 + 372 = 1278. Define Wolf as M; so M = I = 1278. Define Bear as E; so E = M + w = 1278 + 372 = 1650. Define Fox as P; a = E + I = 1650 + 1278 = 2928; B = a + w = 2928 + 372 = 3300; so P = 917 + B = 917 + 3300 = 4217. Define Raccoon as G; V = P + M = 4217 + 1278 = 5495; so G = 70 + V = 70 + 5495 = 5565. Answer: 5565.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 50 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 307.
- The number of Parrot equals 770 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Owl, the number of Parrot, and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay is 50 + 307 = 357.
- The number of Eagle is 770 + 357 + 307 = 1434.
- The number of Parrot is 770 + 357 = 1127.
- The number of Crow is 1434 + 307 + 1127 + 357 = 2225.

**Answer: 2225**<eos>
Define Owl as c; so c = 307. Define Blue Jay as X; U = c = 307; so X = 50 + U = 50 + 307 = 357. Define Parrot as P; p = X + c = 357 + 307 = 664; so P = 770 + p = 770 + 664 = 1434. Define Eagle as B; Z = P + X = 1434 + 357 = 1791; so B = Z + c = 1791 + 307 = 2098. Define Crow as Q; v = B + c = 2098 + 307 = 2405; J = v + P = 2405 + 1434 = 3839; so Q = J + X = 3839 + 357 = 4196.

- The number of Eagle equals 114 plus the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.

**Calculations:**

- The number of Eagle = 114 + (Parrot + Blue Jay + Hawk) = 114 + (148 + Blue Jay + 263 + Blue Jay) = 114 + 411 + 2*Blue Jay = 525 + 2*Blue Jay.
- The number of Crow = 426 + Eagle = 426 + 525 + 2*Blue Jay = 951 + 2*Blue Jay.

**Answer: 951 + 2*Blue Jay**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as r; so r = 748. Define Hawk as W; o = r = 748; so W = 263 + o = 263 + 748 = 1011. Define Parrot as t; y = W + r = 1011 + 748 = 1759; so t = 148 + y = 148 + 1759 = 1907. Define Eagle as w; a = t + r = 1907 + 748 = 2655; l = a + W = 2655 + 1011 = 3666; so w = 114 + l = 114 + 3666 = 3780. Define Crow as d; Z = w = 3780; so d = 426 + Z = 426 + 3780 = 4206. Answer: 4206.

- The number of Deer equals 760 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 540.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Bear, and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon is 558.
- The number of Deer is 760 plus the number of Bear, which is 540, so the number of Deer is 1200.
- The number of Fox is the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Bear, and the number of Deer, which is 558 + 540 + 1200 = 2298.
- The number of Wolf is 373 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Deer, and the number of Raccoon, which is 373 + 2298 + 558 = 3129.

**Answer: 3129**<eos>
Define Bear as C; so C = 540. Define Deer as U; S = C = 540; so U = 760 + S = 760 + 540 = 1300. Define Raccoon as f; l = U + C = 1300 + 540 = 1840; so f = 558 + l = 558 + 1840 = 2398. Define Fox as A; N = f + C = 2398 + 540 = 2938; so A = N + U = 2938 + 1300 = 4238. Define Wolf as s; P = A + U = 4238 + 1300 = 5538; y = P + f = 5538 + 2398 = 7936; so s = 373 + y = 373 + 7936 = 8309. Answer: 8309.

Define Fox as R; so R = 902. Define Elephant as O; c = R = 902; so O = 492 + c = 492 + 902 = 1394. Define Bear as C; z = O = 1394; so C = 497 + z = 497 + 1394 = 1891. Define Deer as Y; D = C + O = 1891 + 1394 = 3285; so Y = D + R = 3285 + 902 = 4187. Define Wolf as e; so e = Y = 4187. Define Raccoon as T; m = e + Y = 4187 + 4187 = 8374; so T = m + O = 8374 + 1394 = 9768. Answer: 9768.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of bear, the number of elephant, and the number of fox.
- the number of wolf equals the number of deer.
- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of wolf, the number of deer, and the number of elephant.
- the number of fox equals 902.
- the number of bear equals 497 plus the number of elephant.
- the number of elephant equals 492 plus the number of fox.

**calculation:**

- the number of deer = bear + elephant + fox = 497 + 492 + 902 = 1891.
- the number of wolf = deer = 1891.
- the number of raccoon = wolf + deer + elephant = 1891 + 1891 + 492 = 4274.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 997.
- The number of Fox equals 503 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 4 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 348 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 337 plus the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Deer, and the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox is 503 + 997 = 1490.
- The number of Wolf is 337 + 348 + 997 = 1682.
- The number of Raccoon is 4 + 1682 = 1686.

**Answer: 1686**<eos>
Define Deer as J; so J = 997. Define Fox as V; O = J = 997; so V = 503 + O = 503 + 997 = 1500. Define Bear as n; l = V + J = 1500 + 997 = 2497; so n = 348 + l = 348 + 2497 = 2845. Define Wolf as y; a = n + J = 2845 + 997 = 3842; k = a + V = 3842 + 1500 = 5342; so y = 337 + k = 337 + 5342 = 5679. Define Raccoon as H; S = y = 5679; so H = 4 + S = 4 + 5679 = 5683. Answer: 5683.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Bear, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 511 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 377 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 949 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 236.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Fox:
Number of Fox = Number of Wolf + Number of Bear + Number of Deer
Number of Fox = 511 + 949 + 236
Number of Fox = 1716

- We can then calculate the number of Wolf:
Number of Wolf = 511 + Number of Bear + Number of Deer
Number of Wolf = 511 + 949 + 236
Number of Wolf = 1716

- The number of Raccoon is given by:
Number of Raccoon = 377 + Number of Fox + Number of Wolf + Number of Bear
Number of Raccoon = 377 + 1716 + 1716 + 949
Number of Raccoon = 5158

**Answer: 5158**<eos>
Define Deer as H; so H = 236. Define Bear as I; i = H = 236; so I = 949 + i = 949 + 236 = 1185. Define Wolf as t; q = I + H = 1185 + 236 = 1421; so t = 511 + q = 511 + 1421 = 1932. Define Fox as v; k = t + I = 1932 + 1185 = 3117; so v = k + H = 3117 + 236 = 3353. Define Raccoon as V; Y = v + t = 3353 + 1932 = 5285; P = Y + I = 5285 + 1185 = 6470; so V = 377 + P = 377 + 6470 = 6847. Answer: 6847.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals the sum of the number of wolf, the number of bear, and the number of deer.

number of fox = 511 + 949 + 236
number of fox = 1716

- we can then calculate the number of wolf:
number of wolf = 511 + number of bear + number of deer
number of wolf = 511 + 949 + 236
number of wolf = 1716

- the number of raccoon is given by:
number of raccoon = 377 + number of fox + number of wolf + number of bear
number of raccoon = 377 + 1716 + 1716 + 949

- The number of Wolf equals 173 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon equals 746 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 410.
- The number of Deer equals 313 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear is 148 + (Deer + Fox + Wolf) = 148 + (313 + 410 + 173) = 148 + 996 = 1144.
- The number of Wolf is 173 + Fox = 173 + 410 = 583.
- The number of Raccoon is 746 + Bear = 746 + 1144 = 1890.

**Answer: 1890**<eos>
Define Fox as K; so K = 410. Define Wolf as U; I = K = 410; so U = 173 + I = 173 + 410 = 583. Define Deer as l; X = U + K = 583 + 410 = 993; so l = 313 + X = 313 + 993 = 1306. Define Bear as t; w = l + K = 1306 + 410 = 1716; d = w + U = 1716 + 583 = 2299; so t = 148 + d = 148 + 2299 = 2447. Define Raccoon as j; u = t = 2447; so j = 746 + u = 746 + 2447 = 3193. Answer: 3193.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 51 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 157 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 433 plus the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Parrot, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals 136 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 1.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl as:
Number of Owl = 51 + (Number of Eagle + Number of Blue Jay)
- We can also calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Number of Blue Jay = 157 + Number of Parrot
- Substituting the above equation into the equation for the number of Owl, we get:
Number of Owl = 51 + (157 + Number of Parrot + Number of Blue Jay)
- Rearranging the equation, we get:
Number of Owl = 208 + Number of Parrot + Number of Blue Jay
- From the given information, we know that the number of Parrot is 1.
- Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
Number of Owl = 208 + 1 + Number of Blue Jay
- We can also calculate the number of Crow as:
Number of Crow = 433 + (Number of Owl + Number of Parrot + Number of Blue Jay)
- Substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of Crow, we get:
Number of Crow = 433 + (208 + 1 + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Parrot + Number of Blue Jay)
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
Number of Crow = 642 + 2 * Number of Blue Jay + Number of Eagle
- We can calculate the number of Eagle as:
Number of Eagle = 136 + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Parrot
- Substituting this value into the equation for the number of Crow, we get:
Number of Crow = 642 + 2 * Number of Blue Jay + 136 + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Parrot
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
Number of Crow = 778 + 3 * Number of Blue Jay + Number of Parrot

**Answer: 778 + 3 * Number of Blue Jay + Number of Parrot**<eos>
Define Parrot as s; so s = 1. Define Blue Jay as y; r = s = 1; so y = 157 + r = 157 + 1 = 158. Define Eagle as n; k = y + s = 158 + 1 = 159; so n = 136 + k = 136 + 159 = 295. Define Owl as q; F = n + y = 295 + 158 = 453; so q = 51 + F = 51 + 453 = 504. Define Crow as L; J = q + s = 504 + 1 = 505; H = J + y = 505 + 158 = 663; so L = 433 + H = 433 + 663 = 1096. Answer: 1096.

- rearranging the equation, we get:
number of owl = 208 + number of parrot + number of blue jay
- from the given information, we know that the number of parrot is 1.
- substituting this value into the equation, we get:
number of owl = 208 + 1 + number of blue jay
- we can also calculate the number of crow as:
number of crow = 433 + (number of owl + number of parrot + number of blue jay)
- substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of crow, we get:
number of crow = 433 + (208 + 1 + number of blue jay + number of parrot + number of blue jay)
- simplifying the equation, we get:
number of crow = 642 + 2 * number of blue jay + number of eagle
- we can calculate the number of eagle as:
number of eagle = 136 + number of blue jay + number of parrot
- substituting this value into the equation for the number of crow, we get:
number of crow = 642 + 2 * number of blue jay + 136 + number of blue jay + number of parrot
- simplifying the equation, we get:
number of crow = 778 + 3 * number of blue jay + number of parrot

**answer: 778 + 3 * number of blue jay + number of parrot**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 31 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 891 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 690 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals 114 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 198.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Sparrow is 31 + Crow = 31 + x (where x is the number of Crow).
- The number of Parrot is 891 + Sparrow + Blue Jay = 891 + (31 + x) + 198 = 1100 + x.
- The number of Owl is 690 + Blue Jay = 690 + 198 = 888.
- The number of Eagle is 114 + Owl + Blue Jay = 114 + 888 + 198 = 1280.
- The number of Crow is Eagle + Owl = 1280 + 888 = 2168.

**Answer: 1100**

**Conclusion:**

The number of Parrot is 1100.<eos>
Define Blue Jay as M; so M = 198. Define Owl as I; p = M = 198; so I = 690 + p = 690 + 198 = 888. Define Eagle as o; q = I + M = 888 + 198 = 1086; so o = 114 + q = 114 + 1086 = 1200. Define Crow as w; so w = o + I = 1200 + 888 = 2088. Define Sparrow as B; v = w = 2088; so B = 31 + v = 31 + 2088 = 2119. Define Parrot as C; f = B + M = 2119 + 198 = 2317; so C = 891 + f = 891 + 2317 = 3208. Answer: 3208.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals 644.

**Calculation:**

Therefore, the number of Deer is 644.

**Answer: 644**<eos>
Define Raccoon as d; so d = 644. Define Bear as U; I = d = 644; so U = 448 + I = 448 + 644 = 1092. Define Tiger as l; X = U = 1092; so l = 513 + X = 513 + 1092 = 1605. Define Fox as G; q = l + U = 1605 + 1092 = 2697; so G = 676 + q = 676 + 2697 = 3373. Define Wolf as L; so L = G + d = 3373 + 644 = 4017. Define Elephant as o; so o = L = 4017. Define Deer as f; so f = o = 4017. Answer: 4017.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 979 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 939.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 735 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Sparrow equals 241 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = 241 + (735 + 939) = 241 + 1674 = 1915
- The number of Crow is calculated as:
Number of Crow = 979 + 1915 + 939 = 3833
- Since the number of Parrot equals the number of Crow, the number of Parrot is 3833.

**Answer: 3833**<eos>
Define Owl as I; so I = 939. Define Blue Jay as x; H = I = 939; so x = 735 + H = 735 + 939 = 1674. Define Sparrow as c; R = x + I = 1674 + 939 = 2613; so c = 241 + R = 241 + 2613 = 2854. Define Eagle as U; K = c + x = 2854 + 1674 = 4528; so U = 979 + K = 979 + 4528 = 5507. Define Crow as n; q = U + c = 5507 + 2854 = 8361; so n = q + x = 8361 + 1674 = 10035. Define Parrot as k; so k = n = 10035. Answer: 10035.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 979 plus the sum of the number of sparrow and the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals 939.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of eagle, the number of sparrow, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of parrot equals the number of crow.
- the number of blue jay equals 735 plus the number of owl.

- The number of Eagle equals 676 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Crow, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 447.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl:
Number of Owl = 295 + Number of Crow = 295 + 447 = 742
- We can also calculate the number of Blue Jay:
Number of Blue Jay = 115 + Number of Owl + Number of Crow = 115 + 742 + 447 = 1304
- From the equation for the number of Parrot, we can calculate the number of Parrot:
Number of Parrot = 390 + Number of Eagle + Number of Blue Jay = 390 + 676 + 1304 = 2370

**Answer: 2370**<eos>
Define Crow as D; so D = 447. Define Owl as X; P = D = 447; so X = 295 + P = 295 + 447 = 742. Define Blue Jay as p; d = X + D = 742 + 447 = 1189; so p = 115 + d = 115 + 1189 = 1304. Define Eagle as t; o = p + D = 1304 + 447 = 1751; j = o + X = 1751 + 742 = 2493; so t = 676 + j = 676 + 2493 = 3169. Define Parrot as u; O = t + p = 3169 + 1304 = 4473; so u = 390 + O = 390 + 4473 = 4863. Answer: 4863.

- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Horse.
- The number of Horse equals 87.
- The number of Fox equals 349.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger = Elephant + Horse + Lion + Wolf
= 0 + 87 + 22 + 349
= 458

**Answer: 458**<eos>
Define Horse as M; so M = 87. Define Lion as F; k = M = 87; so F = 22 + k = 22 + 87 = 109. Define Deer as c; so c = F + M = 109 + 87 = 196. Define Wolf as H; O = c + F = 196 + 109 = 305; so H = O + M = 305 + 87 = 392. Define Elephant as Y; so Y = H + F = 392 + 109 = 501. Define Tiger as I; j = Y + M = 501 + 87 = 588; m = j + F = 588 + 109 = 697; so I = m + H = 697 + 392 = 1089. Answer: 1089.

- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Bear, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon equals 675 + 250 + 767 = 1,692.
- The number of Wolf equals 481 + 1,692 = 2,173.

**Answer: 2,173**<eos>
Define Bear as j; so j = 250. Define Fox as i; t = j = 250; so i = 767 + t = 767 + 250 = 1017. Define Deer as J; b = i + j = 1017 + 250 = 1267; so J = 675 + b = 675 + 1267 = 1942. Define Raccoon as v; M = J + j = 1942 + 250 = 2192; so v = M + i = 2192 + 1017 = 3209. Define Wolf as n; e = v + j = 3209 + 250 = 3459; r = e + J = 3459 + 1942 = 5401; so n = 481 + r = 481 + 5401 = 5882. Answer: 5882.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question!

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals 151 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 484.
- The number of Wolf equals 950 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Deer, the number of Fox, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals 71 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the number of Raccoon:**
Number of Raccoon = 151 + (Number of Deer + Number of Fox)
Number of Raccoon = 151 + (71 + 484)
Number of Raccoon = 151 + 555
Number of Raccoon = 706

2. **Calculate the number of Wolf:**
Number of Wolf = 950 + Number of Raccoon
Number of Wolf = 950 + 706
Number of Wolf = 1656

3. **Calculate the number of Bear:**
Number of Bear = Number of Wolf + Number of Deer + Number of Fox + Number of Raccoon
Number of Bear = 1656 + 71 + 484 + 706
Number of Bear = 3357

**Answer: 3357**<eos>
Define Fox as b; so b = 484. Define Deer as f; R = b = 484; so f = 71 + R = 71 + 484 = 555. Define Raccoon as m; D = f + b = 555 + 484 = 1039; so m = 151 + D = 151 + 1039 = 1190. Define Wolf as l; X = m = 1190; so l = 950 + X = 950 + 1190 = 2140. Define Bear as p; e = l + f = 2140 + 555 = 2695; C = e + b = 2695 + 484 = 3179; so p = C + m = 3179 + 1190 = 4369. Answer: 4369.
**arguments:**

- the number of raccoon equals 151 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 484.
- the number of wolf equals 950 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of bear equals the sum of the number of wolf, the number of deer, the number of fox, and the number of raccoon.
- the number of deer equals 71 plus the number of fox.

**calculation:**

1. **calculate the number of raccoon:**
number of raccoon = 151 + (number of deer + number of fox)
number of raccoon = 151 + (71 + 484)
number of raccoon = 151 + 555
number of raccoon = 706

2. **calculate the number of wolf:**
number of wolf = 950 + number of raccoon
number of wolf = 950 + 706
number of wolf = 1656

3. **calculate the number of bear:**
number of bear = number of wolf + number of deer + number of fox + number of raccoon
number of bear = 1656 + 71 + 484 + 706
number of bear = 3357

- The number of Bear equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 958 plus the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon is 314 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Deer, so the number of Raccoon is 314 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 25 plus the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Deer, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals 958 plus the number of Bear, so the number of Wolf equals 25 plus 958 plus the number of Deer plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Wolf equals 25 + 958 + 382 + 314 = **1659**.

**Answer: 1659**<eos>
Define Deer as u; so u = 382. Define Fox as E; so E = u = 382. Define Raccoon as z; P = E + u = 382 + 382 = 764; so z = 314 + P = 314 + 764 = 1078. Define Bear as h; so h = z = 1078. Define Elephant as I; N = h = 1078; so I = 958 + N = 958 + 1078 = 2036. Define Wolf as e; p = I + u = 2036 + 382 = 2418; b = p + z = 2418 + 1078 = 3496; so e = 25 + b = 25 + 3496 = 3521.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 841 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 8.
- The number of Sparrow equals 835 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Parrot, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 540.
- The number of Eagle equals 839 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Parrot, and the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Blue Jay equals the number of Owl, which equals 841 plus the number of Parrot.
- Therefore, the number of Blue Jay = 841 + 540 = 1381.
- The number of Sparrow equals 835 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Parrot, and the number of Owl.
- Substituting the values we know, we get:
Number of Sparrow = 835 + (839 + 1381 + 540)
= 835 + 2750
= 3585

**Answer: 3585**<eos>
Define Parrot as C; so C = 540. Define Owl as S; c = C = 540; so S = 841 + c = 841 + 540 = 1381. Define Blue Jay as d; so d = S = 1381. Define Eagle as y; J = d + C = 1381 + 540 = 1921; R = J + S = 1921 + 1381 = 3302; so y = 839 + R = 839 + 3302 = 4141. Define Sparrow as h; w = y + C = 4141 + 540 = 4681; b = w + S = 4681 + 1381 = 6062; so h = 835 + b = 835 + 6062 = 6897. Answer: 6897.

- The number of Owl equals 223 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Eagle equals 821 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Number of Blue Jay = 156 + Number of Owl
- We can calculate the number of Owl as:
Number of Owl = 223 + Sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Crow
- We can calculate the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Crow as:
Sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Crow = Number of Eagle + Number of Sparrow + Number of Crow
- We can calculate the number of Eagle as:
Number of Eagle = 821 + Sum of the number of Crow and the number of Sparrow
- We can substitute the above equations into each other to get:
Number of Blue Jay = 156 + (223 + 821 + Number of Crow + Number of Sparrow)
- We can calculate the number of Crow as:
Number of Crow = 8 + Number of Sparrow
- We can substitute the above equation into the equation for Number of Blue Jay to get:
Number of Blue Jay = 156 + (223 + 821 + 8 + Number of Sparrow + Number of Sparrow)
- We can simplify the equation to get:
Number of Blue Jay = 156 + 1012 + 2 * Number of Sparrow
- We can calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Number of Blue Jay = 1168 + 2 * 215 = 1168 + 430 = 1598

**Answer: 1598**<eos>
Define Sparrow as I; so I = 215. Define Crow as z; w = I = 215; so z = 8 + w = 8 + 215 = 223. Define Eagle as S; g = z + I = 223 + 215 = 438; so S = 821 + g = 821 + 438 = 1259. Define Owl as m; t = S + I = 1259 + 215 = 1474; s = t + z = 1474 + 223 = 1697; so m = 223 + s = 223 + 1697 = 1920. Define Blue Jay as C; l = m = 1920; so C = 156 + l = 156 + 1920 = 2076.

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated. Problem: The number of Parrot equals 922 plus the number of Owl.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 922 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 582 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals 925 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Crow equals 360 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 473.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Parrot equals 922 + Owl.
- We also know that the number of Blue Jay equals 582 + Crow + Owl + Parrot.
- Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
  Number of Blue Jay = 582 + Crow + (922 + Owl) + Owl
  Number of Blue Jay = 582 + Crow + 922 + 2 * Owl
- We also know that the number of Eagle equals 925 + Blue Jay.
- Substituting the expression for Blue Jay from above, we get:
  Number of Eagle = 925 + (582 + Crow + 922 + 2 * Owl)
  Number of Eagle = 925 + 582 + Crow + 922 + 2 * Owl
  Number of Eagle = 1507 + Crow + 2 * Owl
- We are given that the number of Owl equals 473.
- Substituting this value into the expression for Eagle, we get:
  Number of Eagle = 1507 + Crow + 2 * 473
  Number of Eagle = 1507 + Crow + 946
  Number of Eagle = 2453 + Crow

**Answer: 2453 + Crow**<eos>
Define Owl as u; so u = 473. Define Parrot as w; j = u = 473; so w = 922 + j = 922 + 473 = 1395. Define Crow as g; d = w + u = 1395 + 473 = 1868; so g = 360 + d = 360 + 1868 = 2228. Define Blue Jay as V; t = g + u = 2228 + 473 = 2701; O = t + w = 2701 + 1395 = 4096; so V = 582 + O = 582 + 4096 = 4678. Define Eagle as v; K = V = 4678; so v = 925 + K = 925 + 4678 = 5603. Answer: 5603.

- the number of owl equals 473.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we know that the number of parrot equals 922 + owl.
- we also know that the number of blue jay equals 582 + crow + owl + parrot.
- substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
  number of blue jay = 582 + crow + (922 + owl) + owl
  number of blue jay = 582 + crow + 922 + 2 * owl
- we also know that the number of eagle equals 925 + blue jay.
- substituting the expression for blue jay from above, we get:
  number of eagle = 925 + (582 + crow + 922 + 2 * owl)
  number of eagle = 925 + 582 + crow + 922 + 2 * owl
  number of eagle = 1507 + crow + 2 * owl
- we are given that the number of owl equals 473.
- substituting this value into the expression for eagle, we get:
  number of eagle = 1507 + crow + 2 * 473
  number of eagle = 1507 + crow + 946
  number of eagle = 2453 + crow

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 985 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals 346 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Bear, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Deer equals 488 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 316.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Fox equals the number of Wolf, which is 316.
- The number of Bear is 985 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Wolf. Therefore, the number of Bear is 985 + (316 + x), where x is the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant is 346 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Wolf. Therefore, the number of Elephant is 346 + (316 + x).
- The number of Raccoon is the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Bear, and the number of Elephant. Therefore, the number of Raccoon is:
  Number of Raccoon = Number of Deer + Number of Bear + Number of Elephant
  = (488 + Number of Bear) + (985 + (316 + x)) + (346 + (316 + x))
  = 488 + 985 + 316 + x + 346 + 316 + x
  = 1925 + 2x

**Answer: Answer: 1925 + 2x**<eos>
Define Wolf as W; so W = 316. Define Fox as p; so p = W = 316. Define Elephant as d; J = p + W = 316 + 316 = 632; so d = 346 + J = 346 + 632 = 978. Define Bear as e; S = d + W = 978 + 316 = 1294; so e = 985 + S = 985 + 1294 = 2279. Define Deer as L; o = e = 2279; so L = 488 + o = 488 + 2279 = 2767. Define Raccoon as h; N = L + e = 2767 + 2279 = 5046; so h = N + d = 5046 + 978 = 6024. Answer: 6024.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals the number of wolf.
- the number of bear equals 985 plus the sum of the number of elephant and the number of wolf.
- the number of elephant equals 346 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of wolf.
- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of deer, the number of bear, and the number of elephant.
- the number of deer equals 488 plus the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals 316.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we know that the number of fox equals the number of wolf, which is 316.
- the number of bear is 985 plus the sum of the number of elephant and the number of wolf. therefore, the number of bear is 985 + (316 + x), where x is the number of elephant.
- the number of elephant is 346 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of wolf. therefore, the number of elephant is 346 + (316 + x).
- the number of raccoon is the sum of the number of deer, the number of bear, and the number of elephant. therefore, the number of raccoon is:
  number of raccoon = number of deer + number of bear + number of elephant
  = (488 + number of bear) + (985 + (316 + x)) + (346 + (316 + x))
  = 488 + 985 + 316 + x + 346 + 316 + x
  = 1925 + 2x

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Wolf, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 63.
- The number of Deer equals 560 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf is 485 + 63 = 548.
- The number of Raccoon is 146 + x, where x is the number of Elephant.
- The number of Bear is Raccoon + Wolf + Elephant = 146 + x + 548 + x = 694 + 2x.
- The number of Elephant is Deer + Fox = 560 + 63 = 623.
- Therefore, the number of Bear is 694 + 2 * 623 = 2034.

**Answer: 2034**<eos>
Define Fox as f; so f = 63. Define Wolf as V; I = f = 63; so V = 485 + I = 485 + 63 = 548. Define Deer as d; S = V + f = 548 + 63 = 611; so d = 560 + S = 560 + 611 = 1171. Define Elephant as j; so j = d + f = 1171 + 63 = 1234. Define Raccoon as t; a = j = 1234; so t = 146 + a = 146 + 1234 = 1380. Define Bear as h; Q = t + V = 1380 + 548 = 1928; so h = Q + j = 1928 + 1234 = 3162. Answer: 3162.

**Answer:**

**Answer: 198 + 2x**<eos>
Define Owl as p; so p = 568. Define Sparrow as Z; j = p = 568; so Z = 217 + j = 217 + 568 = 785. Define Parrot as J; so J = Z = 785. Define Hawk as C; so C = J + Z = 785 + 785 = 1570. Define Eagle as D; G = C + J = 1570 + 785 = 2355; so D = G + Z = 2355 + 785 = 3140. Define Crow as v; so v = D = 3140. Define Blue Jay as R; b = v + Z = 3140 + 785 = 3925; so R = 198 + b = 198 + 3925 = 4123. Answer: 4123.

- The number of Blue Jay equals 730 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 21 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Owl, and the number of Crow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Eagle equals 21 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Owl, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 730 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 571 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 276.
- Therefore, the number of Eagle equals 21 + 730 + 571 + 276 = 1608.
- The number of Parrot equals 648 + 1608 = 2256.

**Answer: 2256**<eos>
Define Owl as x; so x = 276. Define Crow as l; Z = x = 276; so l = 571 + Z = 571 + 276 = 847. Define Blue Jay as U; H = l + x = 847 + 276 = 1123; so U = 730 + H = 730 + 1123 = 1853. Define Eagle as p; a = U + x = 1853 + 276 = 2129; n = a + l = 2129 + 847 = 2976; so p = 21 + n = 21 + 2976 = 2997. Define Parrot as T; c = p = 2997; so T = 648 + c = 648 + 2997 = 3645. Answer: 3645.

- The number of Crow is equal to the number of Eagle (given).
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Hawk equals 789 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 177 plus the number of Eagle.
- Therefore, the number of Sparrow equals the sum of (789 + Parrot + Eagle) + 290 + Eagle.
- Simplifying, the number of Sparrow equals 789 + 2 * Eagle + Parrot.

**Answer: 789 + 2 * Eagle + Parrot**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as D; so D = 290. Define Owl as L; so L = D = 290. Define Crow as M; so M = L + D = 290 + 290 = 580. Define Eagle as n; so n = M = 580. Define Parrot as Z; N = n = 580; so Z = 177 + N = 177 + 580 = 757. Define Hawk as z; s = Z + n = 757 + 580 = 1337; so z = 789 + s = 789 + 1337 = 2126. Define Sparrow as Y; S = z + L = 2126 + 290 = 2416; so Y = S + n = 2416 + 580 = 2996. Answer: 2996.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Deer, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 791 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 504 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 2.
- The number of Deer equals 893 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Raccoon equals the number of Deer, so let's assume both are x.
- The number of Elephant is equal to the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Deer, and the number of Bear. Therefore, the number of Elephant = x + Wolf + 2.
- The number of Fox is equal to 791 plus the number of Bear. Therefore, the number of Fox = 791 + Bear.
- The number of Wolf is equal to 504 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Deer. Therefore, the number of Wolf = 504 + x + x = 504 + 2x.
- The number of Deer is equal to 893 plus the number of Fox. Therefore, the number of Deer = 893 + 791 + Bear = 1684 + Bear.

**Answer:**

The number of Elephant is: x + Wolf + 2 = x + (504 + 2x) + 2 = 3x + 506.<eos>
Define Bear as g; so g = 2. Define Fox as c; I = g = 2; so c = 791 + I = 791 + 2 = 793. Define Deer as h; z = c = 793; so h = 893 + z = 893 + 793 = 1686. Define Raccoon as F; so F = h = 1686. Define Wolf as T; m = F + h = 1686 + 1686 = 3372; so T = 504 + m = 504 + 3372 = 3876. Define Elephant as R; H = T + h = 3876 + 1686 = 5562; so R = H + g = 5562 + 2 = 5564. Answer: 5564.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Blue Jay, the number of Parrot, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 689.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 40 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals 914 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 325 plus the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay = 40 + Crow
- The number of Owl = 914 + (Blue Jay + Parrot)
- The number of Crow = 325 + Parrot
- The number of Eagle = Owl + Blue Jay + Parrot + Crow
- Substituting the above equations, we get:
  Number of Eagle = (914 + (40 + Crow)) + (689) + Parrot + (325 + Parrot)
- Simplifying, we get:
  Number of Eagle = 2328 + 2 * Parrot
- Substituting the value of Parrot = 689, we get:
  Number of Eagle = 2328 + 2 * 689
- Calculating, we get:
  Number of Eagle = 2328 + 1378
**Answer: 3706**<eos>
Define Parrot as s; so s = 689. Define Crow as c; e = s = 689; so c = 325 + e = 325 + 689 = 1014. Define Blue Jay as Z; D = c = 1014; so Z = 40 + D = 40 + 1014 = 1054. Define Owl as o; R = Z + s = 1054 + 689 = 1743; so o = 914 + R = 914 + 1743 = 2657. Define Eagle as u; v = o + Z = 2657 + 1054 = 3711; E = v + s = 3711 + 689 = 4400; so u = E + c = 4400 + 1014 = 5414. Answer: 5414.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 583 plus the sum of the number of Lion, the number of Horse, and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Bear equals 925 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Tiger equals 4 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 503.
- The number of Raccoon equals 624 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Horse.
- The number of Horse equals 34.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Tiger.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Lion = Raccoon + Tiger = R + T
- The number of Tiger = 4 + Wolf = 4 + 503 = 507
- The number of Raccoon = 624 + T + Wolf = 624 + 503 + T = 1127 + T
- The number of Bear = 925 + Lion = 925 + R + T
- The number of Deer = Bear + Raccoon + Tiger = (925 + R + T) + (1127 + T) + T = 2052 + 3T

**Answer: Deer = 2052 + 3T**<eos>
Define Wolf as K; so K = 503. Define Tiger as y; d = K = 503; so y = 4 + d = 4 + 503 = 507. Define Raccoon as b; N = y + K = 507 + 503 = 1010; so b = 624 + N = 624 + 1010 = 1634. Define Lion as z; so z = b + y = 1634 + 507 = 2141. Define Bear as u; A = z = 2141; so u = 925 + A = 925 + 2141 = 3066. Define Deer as S; t = u + b = 3066 + 1634 = 4700; so S = t + y = 4700 + 507 = 5207. Answer: 5207.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 235 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Parrot, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 948 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 815 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 168 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 652.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Number of Blue Jay = 815 + Number of Owl
- We can also calculate the number of Parrot as:
Number of Parrot = 168 + Number of Eagle
- Substituting the value of Number of Eagle from the given information, we get:
Number of Parrot = 168 + 652 = 820
- Using the equation for the number of Crow, we can calculate the number of Crow as:
Number of Crow = 235 + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Parrot
- Substituting the values we calculated above, we get:
Number of Crow = 235 + (815 + Number of Owl) + 820
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
Number of Crow = 235 + 815 + Number of Owl + 820
- Combining like terms, we get:
Number of Crow = 1870 + Number of Owl

**Answer: 1870 + Number of Owl**<eos>
Define Eagle as x; so x = 652. Define Parrot as C; i = x = 652; so C = 168 + i = 168 + 652 = 820. Define Owl as u; a = C + x = 820 + 652 = 1472; so u = 948 + a = 948 + 1472 = 2420. Define Blue Jay as S; M = u = 2420; so S = 815 + M = 815 + 2420 = 3235. Define Crow as O; Z = S + C = 3235 + 820 = 4055; m = Z + x = 4055 + 652 = 4707; so O = 235 + m = 235 + 4707 = 4942. Answer: 4942.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 332 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Hawk equals 692.
- The number of Owl equals 737 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 934.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Sparrow = Owl + Eagle + Blue Jay + Crow
= (737 + Blue Jay + Eagle) + 934 + Blue Jay + Crow
= 737 + 2 * Blue Jay + Crow

- The number of Parrot = 332 + Eagle
= 332 + 934 = 1266

- The number of Blue Jay = Crow + Eagle
= Crow + 934

- The number of Crow = Parrot + Eagle
= 1266 + 934 = 2100

- The number of Sparrow = 737 + 2 * (Crow + Eagle) + Crow
= 737 + 2 * (2100 + 934) + 2100
= 737 + 4268 + 2100
= 9505

**Answer: 9505**<eos>
Define Eagle as N; so N = 934. Define Parrot as y; r = N = 934; so y = 332 + r = 332 + 934 = 1266. Define Crow as I; so I = y + N = 1266 + 934 = 2200. Define Blue Jay as L; so L = I + N = 2200 + 934 = 3134. Define Owl as S; m = L + N = 3134 + 934 = 4068; so S = 737 + m = 737 + 4068 = 4805. Define Sparrow as a; E = S + N = 4805 + 934 = 5739; W = E + L = 5739 + 3134 = 8873; so a = W + I = 8873 + 2200 = 11073. Answer: 11073.
**arguments:**

- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of owl, the number of eagle, the number of blue jay, and the number of crow.
- the number of parrot equals 332 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of hawk equals 692.

- The number of Parrot is 822 + 628 = 1450.

**Answer: 1450**<eos>
Define Owl as n; so n = 281. Define Eagle as z; t = n = 281; so z = 472 + t = 472 + 281 = 753. Define Blue Jay as Y; J = z + n = 753 + 281 = 1034; so Y = 398 + J = 398 + 1034 = 1432. Define Crow as L; E = Y + n = 1432 + 281 = 1713; q = E + z = 1713 + 753 = 2466; so L = 347 + q = 347 + 2466 = 2813. Define Parrot as I; B = L + n = 2813 + 281 = 3094; so I = 822 + B = 822 + 3094 = 3916. Answer: 3916.

- The number of Peacock equals 1751 + 1751 + 1751 = 5253.

**Answer: 5253**<eos>
Define Eagle as I; T = None = 500; so I = 809 + T = 809 + 500 = 1309. Define Penguin as Y; B = I = 1309; so Y = 942 + B = 942 + 1309 = 2251. Define Blue Jay as s; so s = Y + I = 2251 + 1309 = 3560. Define Hawk as l; v = s + Y = 3560 + 2251 = 5811; so l = v + I = 5811 + 1309 = 7120. Define Parrot as O; so O = l = 7120. Define Peacock as K; z = O + s = 7120 + 3560 = 10680; so K = z + l = 10680 + 7120 = 17800. Answer: 17800.

- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 62 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Parrot equals 867.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Eagle equals the number of Parrot, which we can denote as x.
- The number of Penguin equals the number of Eagle, so the number of Penguin is also x.
- The number of Owl is 169 plus the number of Parrot, so the number of Owl is x + 169.
- The number of Crow is 856 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Parrot, so the number of Crow is 856 + x.
- The number of Blue Jay is 630 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Sparrow, so the number of Blue Jay is 630 + (856 + x) = 1486 + x.
- The number of Hawk is the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Sparrow, so the number of Hawk is 1486 + x + 62 = 1548 + x.

**Answer:**

**Answer: 1548 + x**<eos>
Define Parrot as a; so a = 867. Define Eagle as e; so e = a = 867. Define Penguin as x; so x = e = 867. Define Sparrow as s; n = x = 867; so s = 62 + n = 62 + 867 = 929. Define Crow as A; z = s + a = 929 + 867 = 1796; so A = 856 + z = 856 + 1796 = 2652. Define Blue Jay as D; N = A + s = 2652 + 929 = 3581; so D = 630 + N = 630 + 3581 = 4211. Define Hawk as q; so q = D + s = 4211 + 929 = 5140. Answer: 5140.

- The number of Raccoon equals 691.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer.
=> The number of Bear = 483 + Wolf + 578
- The number of Elephant equals 400 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Fox.
=> The number of Elephant = 400 + (483 + Wolf + 578) + 483
- The number of Raccoon equals 691.

**Answer:**

**Answer: 2321**<eos>
Define Raccoon as l; so l = 691. Define Deer as V; x = l = 691; so V = 578 + x = 578 + 691 = 1269. Define Wolf as Z; so Z = V + l = 1269 + 691 = 1960. Define Fox as w; H = Z = 1960; so w = 483 + H = 483 + 1960 = 2443. Define Bear as s; o = w + Z = 2443 + 1960 = 4403; so s = o + V = 4403 + 1269 = 5672. Define Elephant as b; U = s + w = 5672 + 2443 = 8115; so b = 400 + U = 400 + 8115 = 8515. Answer: 8515.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals 259.
- The number of Raccoon equals 88 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 50 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Elephant, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

1. From the given information, we know that the number of Bear equals the number of Wolf. Let's assume both are x.
2. The number of Raccoon equals 88 plus the number of Fox. Let's denote the number of Fox as y. Therefore, the number of Raccoon is: R = 88 + y.
3. The number of Wolf equals the number of Deer. So, x = 50 + E.
4. The number of Deer equals 50 plus the number of Elephant. Therefore, E = 50 + 259 = 309.
5. The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Elephant, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer. So, y = x + E + x + 309.
6. Substituting the value of x and E from steps 1 and 3, we get: y = x + 309 + x + x + 309 = 3x + 618.
7. Therefore, the number of Raccoon is: R = 88 + y = 88 + 3x + 618 = 3x + 706.

**Answer: Answer: 3x + 706**<eos>
Define Elephant as x; so x = 259. Define Deer as w; E = x = 259; so w = 50 + E = 50 + 259 = 309. Define Wolf as e; so e = w = 309. Define Bear as X; so X = e = 309. Define Fox as F; P = X + x = 309 + 259 = 568; l = P + e = 568 + 309 = 877; so F = l + w = 877 + 309 = 1186. Define Raccoon as a; Z = F = 1186; so a = 88 + Z = 88 + 1186 = 1274. Answer: 1274.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals the number of wolf.
- the number of elephant equals 259.
- the number of raccoon equals 88 plus the number of fox.
- the number of wolf equals the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 50 plus the number of elephant.
- the number of fox equals the sum of the number of bear, the number of elephant, the number of wolf, and the number of deer.

**calculation:**

1. from the given information, we know that the number of bear equals the number of wolf. let's assume both are x.
2. the number of raccoon equals 88 plus the number of fox. let's denote the number of fox as y. therefore, the number of raccoon is: r = 88 + y.
3. the number of wolf equals the number of deer. so, x = 50 + e.
4. the number of deer equals 50 plus the number of elephant. therefore, e = 50 + 259 = 309.
5. the number of fox equals the sum of the number of bear, the number of elephant, the number of wolf, and the number of deer. so, y = x + e + x + 309.
6. substituting the value of x and e from steps 1 and 3, we get: y = x + 309 + x + x + 309 = 3x + 618.
7. therefore, the number of raccoon is: r = 88 + y = 88 + 3x + 618 = 3x + 706.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Falcon equals the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 540 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 87.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Owl, and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Falcon equals the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.
- We also know that the number of Parrot equals 540 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- Therefore, we can write an equation to represent the number of Falcon:
Number of Falcon = Number of Parrot + Number of Owl
- Substituting the expression for Number of Parrot from the given information, we get:
Number of Falcon = (540 + Number of Crow + Number of Owl) + Number of Owl
- Combining like terms, we get:
Number of Falcon = 540 + Number of Crow + 2 * Number of Owl
- We also know that the number of Owl equals 87.
- Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
Number of Falcon = 540 + Number of Crow + 2 * 87
- Simplifying further, we get:
Number of Falcon = 540 + Number of Crow + 174
- Therefore, the number of Falcon is equal to 540 + Number of Crow + 174.

**Answer: Answer: 540 + Number of Crow + 174**<eos>
Define Owl as x; so x = 87. Define Blue Jay as j; Z = x = 87; so j = 83 + Z = 83 + 87 = 170. Define Eagle as f; so f = j + x = 170 + 87 = 257. Define Crow as c; m = f + x = 257 + 87 = 344; so c = m + j = 344 + 170 = 514. Define Parrot as P; l = c + x = 514 + 87 = 601; E = l + f = 601 + 257 = 858; so P = 540 + E = 540 + 858 = 1398. Define Falcon as K; so K = P + x = 1398 + 87 = 1485. Answer: 1485.
**arguments:**

- the number of falcon equals the sum of the number of parrot and the number of owl.
- the number of parrot equals 540 plus the sum of the number of crow, the number of owl, and the number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals 87.

- therefore, we can write an equation to represent the number of falcon:
number of falcon = number of parrot + number of owl
- substituting the expression for number of parrot from the given information, we get:
number of falcon = (540 + number of crow + number of owl) + number of owl
- combining like terms, we get:
number of falcon = 540 + number of crow + 2 * number of owl
- we also know that the number of owl equals 87.
- substituting this value into the equation, we get:
number of falcon = 540 + number of crow + 2 * 87
- simplifying further, we get:
number of falcon = 540 + number of crow + 174

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 229.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 216 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 331 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 306 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Deer, and the number of Raccoon.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Wolf as follows:
Number of Wolf = 216 + (Number of Raccoon + Number of Deer)
- We can also calculate the number of Fox as follows:
Number of Fox = Number of Elephant + Number of Wolf
- And the number of Bear as follows:
Number of Bear = Number of Fox + Number of Wolf
- Substituting the above equations, we get:
Number of Bear = (Number of Elephant + Number of Wolf) + (Number of Elephant + Number of Wolf)
= 2 * (Number of Elephant + Number of Wolf) + Number of Deer
= 2 * (306 + Number of Wolf) + 229
= 612 + 2 * Number of Wolf + 229
= 841 + 2 * Number of Wolf

**Answer: 841 + 2 * Number of Wolf**<eos>
Define Deer as e; so e = 229. Define Raccoon as x; U = e = 229; so x = 331 + U = 331 + 229 = 560. Define Wolf as g; m = x + e = 560 + 229 = 789; so g = 216 + m = 216 + 789 = 1005. Define Elephant as r; C = g + e = 1005 + 229 = 1234; X = C + x = 1234 + 560 = 1794; so r = 306 + X = 306 + 1794 = 2100. Define Fox as k; so k = r + g = 2100 + 1005 = 3105. Define Bear as Z; so Z = k + g = 3105 + 1005 = 4110. Answer: 4110.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals the sum of the number of fox and the number of wolf.
- the number of deer equals 229.
- the number of fox equals the sum of the number of elephant and the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 216 plus the sum of the number of raccoon and the number of deer.
- the number of raccoon equals 331 plus the number of deer.
- the number of elephant equals 306 plus the sum of the number of wolf, the number of deer, and the number of raccoon.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of wolf as follows:
number of wolf = 216 + (number of raccoon + number of deer)
- we can also calculate the number of fox as follows:
number of fox = number of elephant + number of wolf
- and the number of bear as follows:
number of bear = number of fox + number of wolf
- substituting the above equations, we get:
number of bear = (number of elephant + number of wolf) + (number of elephant + number of wolf)
= 2 * (number of elephant + number of wolf) + number of deer
= 2 * (306 + number of wolf) + 229
= 612 + 2 * number of wolf + 229
= 841 + 2 * number of wolf

**answer: 841 + 2 * number of wolf**<eos>

- The number of Blue Jay is 631 + 802 + 753 = 2186.
- The number of Crow is 2186 + 753 + 802 = 3731.

**Answer: 3731**<eos>
Define Parrot as R; so R = 753. Define Owl as F; N = R = 753; so F = 149 + N = 149 + 753 = 902. Define Eagle as J; so J = F = 902. Define Blue Jay as O; u = J + R = 902 + 753 = 1655; e = u + F = 1655 + 902 = 2557; so O = 631 + e = 631 + 2557 = 3188. Define Crow as B; Q = O + R = 3188 + 753 = 3941; s = Q + F = 3941 + 902 = 4843; so B = s + J = 4843 + 902 = 5745. Answer: 5745.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals 947 plus the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 160 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 399.
- The number of Deer equals 941 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 716 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon = 947 + (Bear + Fox + Wolf)
- The number of Bear = 160 + Fox
- The number of Wolf = 399
- The number of Fox = 716 + (Deer + Wolf)
- The number of Deer = 941 + Wolf
- Substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of Raccoon, we get:
  Number of Raccoon = 947 + (160 + Fox + 399) + Fox + (716 + (941 + Wolf))
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
  Number of Raccoon = 947 + 559 + 2*Fox + 1655 + Wolf
- Combining like terms, we get:
  Number of Raccoon = 2771 + 2*Fox + Wolf

**Answer: 2771 + 2*Fox + Wolf**<eos>
Define Wolf as X; so X = 399. Define Deer as l; i = X = 399; so l = 941 + i = 941 + 399 = 1340. Define Fox as y; v = l + X = 1340 + 399 = 1739; so y = 716 + v = 716 + 1739 = 2455. Define Bear as k; z = y = 2455; so k = 160 + z = 160 + 2455 = 2615. Define Raccoon as x; D = k + y = 2615 + 2455 = 5070; S = D + X = 5070 + 399 = 5469; so x = 947 + S = 947 + 5469 = 6416. Answer: 6416.

- the number of bear = 160 + fox
- the number of wolf = 399
- the number of fox = 716 + (deer + wolf)
- the number of deer = 941 + wolf
- substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of raccoon, we get:
  number of raccoon = 947 + (160 + fox + 399) + fox + (716 + (941 + wolf))
- simplifying the equation, we get:
  number of raccoon = 947 + 559 + 2*fox + 1655 + wolf
- combining like terms, we get:
  number of raccoon = 2771 + 2*fox + wolf

- The number of Tiger equals 7 + 530 = 537.
- The number of Horse equals 313 + 537 = 850.

**Answer: 850**<eos>
Define Raccoon as d; so d = 361. Define Lion as C; j = d = 361; so C = 683 + j = 683 + 361 = 1044. Define Wolf as L; Z = C + d = 1044 + 361 = 1405; so L = 169 + Z = 169 + 1405 = 1574. Define Tiger as s; w = L = 1574; so s = 7 + w = 7 + 1574 = 1581. Define Horse as A; X = s + L = 1581 + 1574 = 3155; R = X + d = 3155 + 361 = 3516; so A = 313 + R = 313 + 3516 = 3829. Answer: 3829.
**arguments:**

- the number of horse equals 313 plus the sum of the number of tiger, the number of wolf, and the number of raccoon.
- the number of tiger equals 7 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 169 plus the sum of the number of lion and the number of raccoon.
- the number of lion equals 683 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of raccoon equals 361.

**calculation:**

- the number of wolf equals 169 + 361 = 530.
- the number of tiger equals 7 + 530 = 537.
- the number of horse equals 313 + 537 = 850.

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated. Problem: The number of Wolf equals 594. The number of Fox equals 179 plus the number of Wolf.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf is 594.
- The number of Fox is 179 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear is 728 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon is the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer is the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Fox, the number of Bear, and the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox is 179 + 594 = 773.
- The number of Bear is 728 + 773 = 1401.
- The number of Raccoon is 1401 + 773 + 594 = 2768.
- The number of Deer is 2768 + 773 + 1401 + 594 = 5136.

**Answer: 5136**<eos>
Define Wolf as B; so B = 594. Define Fox as D; f = B = 594; so D = 179 + f = 179 + 594 = 773. Define Bear as P; r = D = 773; so P = 728 + r = 728 + 773 = 1501. Define Raccoon as j; y = P + D = 1501 + 773 = 2274; so j = y + B = 2274 + 594 = 2868. Define Deer as l; C = j + D = 2868 + 773 = 3641; o = C + P = 3641 + 1501 = 5142; so l = o + B = 5142 + 594 = 5736. Answer: 5736.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 101 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Parrot, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Sparrow equals 109 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 334 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 334.
- The number of Parrot equals 139.
- The number of Crow equals 315 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle as:
Number of Eagle = 101 + (Number of Sparrow + Number of Parrot + Number of Blue Jay)
- We can also calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = 109 + (Number of Blue Jay + Number of Parrot)
- And the number of Blue Jay as:
Number of Blue Jay = 334 + Number of Parrot
- Substituting these expressions into the equation for the number of Eagle, we get:
Number of Eagle = 101 + (109 + (334 + Number of Parrot) + Number of Parrot)
- Simplifying this equation, we find:
Number of Eagle = 101 + 463 + 2 * Number of Parrot
- Therefore, the number of Parrot can be calculated as:
Number of Parrot = (Number of Eagle - 101 - 463) / 2
- Finally, we can calculate the number of Crow as:
Number of Crow = 315 + Number of Eagle
- Substituting the value of Number of Eagle we found earlier, we get:
Number of Crow = 315 + (101 + 463 + 2 * Number of Parrot)
- Simplifying this equation, we find:
Number of Crow = 679 + 2 * Number of Parrot

**Answer: Answer: 679 + 2 * Number of Parrot**<eos>
Define Parrot as n; so n = 139. Define Blue Jay as h; N = n = 139; so h = 334 + N = 334 + 139 = 473. Define Sparrow as j; o = h + n = 473 + 139 = 612; so j = 109 + o = 109 + 612 = 721. Define Eagle as p; Q = j + n = 721 + 139 = 860; b = Q + h = 860 + 473 = 1333; so p = 101 + b = 101 + 1333 = 1434. Define Crow as C; L = p = 1434; so C = 315 + L = 315 + 1434 = 1749. Answer: 1749.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 101 plus the sum of the number of sparrow, the number of parrot, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of sparrow equals 109 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of parrot.
- the number of blue jay equals 334 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals 334.
- the number of parrot equals 139.
- the number of crow equals 315 plus the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of eagle as:
number of eagle = 101 + (number of sparrow + number of parrot + number of blue jay)
- we can also calculate the number of sparrow as:
number of sparrow = 109 + (number of blue jay + number of parrot)
- and the number of blue jay as:
number of blue jay = 334 + number of parrot
- substituting these expressions into the equation for the number of eagle, we get:
number of eagle = 101 + (109 + (334 + number of parrot) + number of parrot)
- simplifying this equation, we find:
number of eagle = 101 + 463 + 2 * number of parrot
- therefore, the number of parrot can be calculated as:
number of parrot = (number of eagle - 101 - 463) / 2
- finally, we can calculate the number of crow as:
number of crow = 315 + number of eagle
- substituting the value of number of eagle we found earlier, we get:
number of crow = 315 + (101 + 463 + 2 * number of parrot)
- simplifying this equation, we find:
number of crow = 679 + 2 * number of parrot

**answer: answer: 679 + 2 * number of parrot**<eos>

- The number of Deer equals 354.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Deer, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals 757 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals 44 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 455 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf equals the number of Deer = 354.
- The number of Raccoon = Bear + Deer + Wolf = Bear + 354 + Wolf.
- The number of Elephant = 757 + Raccoon = 757 + Bear + 354 + Wolf.
- The number of Bear = 44 + Wolf.
- The number of Fox = 455 + Elephant + Deer = 455 + (757 + Bear + 354 + Wolf) + 354.

**Answer:**

**Answer: 1541**<eos>
Define Deer as l; so l = 354. Define Wolf as j; so j = l = 354. Define Bear as H; G = j = 354; so H = 44 + G = 44 + 354 = 398. Define Raccoon as c; B = H + l = 398 + 354 = 752; so c = B + j = 752 + 354 = 1106. Define Elephant as v; f = c = 1106; so v = 757 + f = 757 + 1106 = 1863. Define Fox as X; r = v + l = 1863 + 354 = 2217; so X = 455 + r = 455 + 2217 = 2672. Answer: 2672.

- The number of Wolf equals 692 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 354 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Bear, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals 558 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Wolf, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals 857.
- The number of Raccoon equals 951 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf is 692 + Bear = 692 + 857 = 1549.
- The number of Raccoon is 951 + Wolf = 951 + 1549 = 2490.
- The number of Deer is 354 + Raccoon + Bear + Wolf = 354 + 2490 + 857 + 1549 = 5230.
- The number of Elephant is 558 + Deer + Wolf + Raccoon = 558 + 5230 + 1549 + 2490 = 10757.

**Answer: 10757**<eos>
Define Bear as k; so k = 857. Define Wolf as Q; W = k = 857; so Q = 692 + W = 692 + 857 = 1549. Define Raccoon as X; p = Q = 1549; so X = 951 + p = 951 + 1549 = 2500. Define Deer as o; m = X + k = 2500 + 857 = 3357; C = m + Q = 3357 + 1549 = 4906; so o = 354 + C = 354 + 4906 = 5260. Define Elephant as u; K = o + Q = 5260 + 1549 = 6809; c = K + X = 6809 + 2500 = 9309; so u = 558 + c = 558 + 9309 = 9867. Answer: 9867.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals 676.
- the number of wolf equals 692 plus the number of bear.
- the number of deer equals 354 plus the sum of the number of raccoon, the number of bear, and the number of wolf.
- the number of elephant equals 558 plus the sum of the number of deer, the number of wolf, and the number of raccoon.
- the number of bear equals 857.
- the number of raccoon equals 951 plus the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- the number of wolf is 692 + bear = 692 + 857 = 1549.
- the number of raccoon is 951 + wolf = 951 + 1549 = 2490.
- the number of deer is 354 + raccoon + bear + wolf = 354 + 2490 + 857 + 1549 = 5230.
- the number of elephant is 558 + deer + wolf + raccoon = 558 + 5230 + 1549 + 2490 = 10757.

- The number of Sparrow equals 852 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 114.
- The number of Eagle equals the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

1. The number of Parrot is:
Parrot = Eagle + Sparrow + Crow + Owl
Parrot = Eagle + 852 + 114 + (602 + Crow)
Parrot = Eagle + 1560 + Crow

2. The number of Blue Jay is:
Blue Jay = 143 + Parrot
Blue Jay = 143 + (Eagle + 1560 + Crow)
Blue Jay = Eagle + 1703 + Crow

3. The number of Eagle is:
Eagle = Sparrow
Eagle = 852 + Owl

4. The number of Owl is:
Owl = 602 + Crow
Owl = 602 + 114
Owl = 716

5. The number of Crow is:
Crow = 114

**Answer:**

**Answer: 1703 + 114 = 1817**<eos>
Define Crow as h; so h = 114. Define Owl as y; g = h = 114; so y = 602 + g = 602 + 114 = 716. Define Sparrow as m; W = y + h = 716 + 114 = 830; so m = 852 + W = 852 + 830 = 1682. Define Eagle as R; so R = m = 1682. Define Parrot as Y; p = R + m = 1682 + 1682 = 3364; v = p + h = 3364 + 114 = 3478; so Y = v + y = 3478 + 716 = 4194. Define Blue Jay as P; j = Y = 4194; so P = 143 + j = 143 + 4194 = 4337. Answer: 4337.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals 63 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Elephant equals 202 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Deer equals 13.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Tiger, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 606 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 235 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 475.
- The number of Raccoon equals 836 plus the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger is 63 + Bear = 63 + x (where x is the number of Bear).
- The number of Elephant is 202 + Tiger = 202 + 63 + x = 265 + x.
- The number of Lion is Elephant + Tiger + Wolf = (265 + x) + (63 + x) + Wolf = 328 + 2x + Wolf.
- The number of Fox is 606 + Wolf + Deer = 606 + (475 - x) + 13 = 1094 - x.
- The number of Raccoon is 836 + Lion + Elephant = 836 + (328 + 2x + Wolf) + (265 + x) = 1429 + 3x + Wolf.

**Answer:** Raccoon = 1429 + 3x + Wolf<eos>
Define Wolf as o; so o = 475. Define Bear as C; d = o = 475; so C = 235 + d = 235 + 475 = 710. Define Tiger as w; e = C = 710; so w = 63 + e = 63 + 710 = 773. Define Elephant as t; y = w = 773; so t = 202 + y = 202 + 773 = 975. Define Lion as b; l = t + w = 975 + 773 = 1748; so b = l + o = 1748 + 475 = 2223. Define Raccoon as h; Y = b + t = 2223 + 975 = 3198; so h = 836 + Y = 836 + 3198 = 4034. Answer: 4034.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 409.
- The number of Hawk equals 431 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Peacock equals the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Crow equals 780 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Penguin equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Sparrow equals 794.
- The number of Eagle equals 257 plus the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot is the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Eagle.
Therefore, the number of Parrot = 431 + number of Penguin.
- The number of Blue Jay is the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
Therefore, the number of Blue Jay = 780 + 409 + 257 + number of Owl.
- The number of Penguin is the number of Eagle.
Therefore, the number of Penguin = 257.
- The number of Hawk is 431 plus the number of Penguin.
Therefore, the number of Hawk = 431 + 257 = 688.
- The number of Parrot is the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Eagle.
Therefore, the number of Parrot = 688 + 257 = 945.
- The number of Blue Jay is the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
Therefore, the number of Blue Jay = 780 + 409 + 257 + 409 = 1953.

**Answer: 1953**<eos>
Define Owl as t; so t = 409. Define Eagle as H; a = t = 409; so H = 257 + a = 257 + 409 = 666. Define Penguin as O; so O = H = 666. Define Hawk as h; W = O = 666; so h = 431 + W = 431 + 666 = 1097. Define Parrot as y; so y = h + H = 1097 + 666 = 1763. Define Crow as m; s = y = 1763; so m = 780 + s = 780 + 1763 = 2543. Define Blue Jay as U; F = m + t = 2543 + 409 = 2952; so U = F + H = 2952 + 666 = 3618. Answer: 3618.

- the number of eagle equals 257 plus the number of owl.

**calculation:**

- the number of parrot is the sum of the number of hawk and the number of eagle.
therefore, the number of parrot = 431 + number of penguin.
- the number of blue jay is the sum of the number of crow, the number of owl, and the number of eagle.
therefore, the number of blue jay = 780 + 409 + 257 + number of owl.
- the number of penguin is the number of eagle.
therefore, the number of penguin = 257.
- the number of hawk is 431 plus the number of penguin.
therefore, the number of hawk = 431 + 257 = 688.
- the number of parrot is the sum of the number of hawk and the number of eagle.
therefore, the number of parrot = 688 + 257 = 945.
- the number of blue jay is the sum of the number of crow, the number of owl, and the number of eagle.
therefore, the number of blue jay = 780 + 409 + 257 + 409 = 1953.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Eagle, and the number of Penguin.
- The number of Crow equals 189 plus the number of Peacock.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 569 plus the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot = Crow + Eagle + Penguin
= (189 + Peacock) + (569 + Owl) + (Eagle + Owl)
= 189 + Peacock + 569 + Owl + Eagle + Owl
= 189 + 577 + 569 + Owl + Owl
= 189 + 577 + 569 + 2 * Owl
= 1434 + 2 * Owl

**Answer: 1434 + 2 * Owl**<eos>
Define Owl as U; so U = 618. Define Eagle as G; n = U = 618; so G = 569 + n = 569 + 618 = 1187. Define Penguin as s; so s = G + U = 1187 + 618 = 1805. Define Sparrow as w; so w = s + G = 1805 + 1187 = 2992. Define Peacock as E; X = w = 2992; so E = 577 + X = 577 + 2992 = 3569. Define Crow as k; D = E = 3569; so k = 189 + D = 189 + 3569 = 3758. Define Parrot as p; L = k + G = 3758 + 1187 = 4945; so p = L + s = 4945 + 1805 = 6750. Answer: 6750.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals the sum of the number of crow, the number of eagle, and the number of penguin.
- the number of crow equals 189 plus the number of peacock.
- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of penguin and the number of eagle.
- the number of penguin equals the sum of the number of eagle and the number of owl.
- the number of eagle equals 569 plus the number of owl.

**calculation:**

- the number of parrot = crow + eagle + penguin
= (189 + peacock) + (569 + owl) + (eagle + owl)
= 189 + peacock + 569 + owl + eagle + owl
= 189 + 577 + 569 + owl + owl
= 189 + 577 + 569 + 2 * owl
= 1434 + 2 * owl

**answer: 1434 + 2 * owl**<eos>

- The number of Wolf is 41 + 1392 = 1433.

**Answer: 343**

**Conclusion:**

The number of Bear is 343.<eos>
Define Elephant as d; so d = 87. Define Raccoon as T; F = d = 87; so T = 616 + F = 616 + 87 = 703. Define Deer as C; q = T + d = 703 + 87 = 790; so C = 689 + q = 689 + 790 = 1479. Define Wolf as D; Z = C = 1479; so D = 41 + Z = 41 + 1479 = 1520. Define Tiger as H; so H = D = 1520. Define Fox as I; so I = H + D = 1520 + 1520 = 3040. Define Bear as v; E = I + d = 3040 + 87 = 3127; so v = 256 + E = 256 + 3127 = 3383. Answer: 3383.

- The number of Horse equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Lion, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 342.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon = Fox + Lion + Deer = 342
- The number of Horse = Raccoon = 342

**Answer: 342**<eos>
Define Deer as q; so q = 342. Define Elephant as c; P = q = 342; so c = 760 + P = 760 + 342 = 1102. Define Lion as s; so s = c + q = 1102 + 342 = 1444. Define Tiger as r; T = s = 1444; so r = 265 + T = 265 + 1444 = 1709. Define Fox as t; z = r + q = 1709 + 342 = 2051; so t = 161 + z = 161 + 2051 = 2212. Define Raccoon as a; Q = t + s = 2212 + 1444 = 3656; so a = Q + q = 3656 + 342 = 3998. Define Horse as m; so m = a = 3998. Answer: 3998.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 984 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Eagle equals 796.
- The number of Owl equals 717 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 843 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Hawk as:
Number of Hawk = Number of Crow + Number of Sparrow
- We can also calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = Number of Owl + Number of Eagle
- Substituting the above equation into the equation for Number of Hawk, we get:
Number of Hawk = Number of Crow + (Number of Owl + Number of Eagle)
- Combining like terms, we have:
Number of Hawk = Number of Crow + Number of Owl + Number of Eagle
- From the given information, we know that the number of Eagle equals 796.
- We can also calculate the number of Parrot as:
Number of Parrot = 843 + Number of Sparrow
- Substituting the above equation into the equation for Number of Crow, we get:
Number of Crow = Number of Parrot + Number of Owl + Number of Eagle
- Combining like terms, we have:
Number of Crow = (843 + Number of Sparrow) + Number of Owl + 796
- We can now substitute the values we know into the above equations to calculate the number of Blue Jay:
Number of Blue Jay = 984 + Number of Hawk
= 984 + (Number of Crow + Number of Owl + Number of Eagle)
= 984 + ((843 + Number of Sparrow) + Number of Owl + 796)
= 984 + (843 + 717 + Number of Owl)
= 984 + 1560 + Number of Owl
= 2544 + Number of Owl

**Answer: 2544 + Number of Owl**<eos>
Define Eagle as T; so T = 796. Define Owl as b; D = T = 796; so b = 717 + D = 717 + 796 = 1513. Define Sparrow as j; so j = b + T = 1513 + 796 = 2309. Define Parrot as n; M = j = 2309; so n = 843 + M = 843 + 2309 = 3152. Define Crow as Z; w = n + b = 3152 + 1513 = 4665; so Z = w + T = 4665 + 796 = 5461. Define Hawk as q; so q = Z + j = 5461 + 2309 = 7770. Define Blue Jay as r; g = q = 7770; so r = 984 + g = 984 + 7770 = 8754. Answer: 8754.
**arguments:**

- the number of hawk equals the sum of the number of crow and the number of sparrow.
- the number of blue jay equals 984 plus the number of hawk.
- the number of eagle equals 796.
- the number of owl equals 717 plus the number of eagle.

- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of owl and the number of eagle.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of parrot, the number of owl, and the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of hawk as:
number of hawk = number of crow + number of sparrow
- we can also calculate the number of sparrow as:
number of sparrow = number of owl + number of eagle
- substituting the above equation into the equation for number of hawk, we get:
number of hawk = number of crow + (number of owl + number of eagle)
- combining like terms, we have:
number of hawk = number of crow + number of owl + number of eagle
- from the given information, we know that the number of eagle equals 796.
- we can also calculate the number of parrot as:
number of parrot = 843 + number of sparrow
- substituting the above equation into the equation for number of crow, we get:
number of crow = number of parrot + number of owl + number of eagle
- combining like terms, we have:
number of crow = (843 + number of sparrow) + number of owl + 796
- we can now substitute the values we know into the above equations to calculate the number of blue jay:
number of blue jay = 984 + number of hawk
= 984 + (number of crow + number of owl + number of eagle)
= 984 + ((843 + number of sparrow) + number of owl + 796)
= 984 + (843 + 717 + number of owl)
= 984 + 1560 + number of owl
= 2544 + number of owl

- The number of Hawk is 130 + 67 = 197.
- The number of Owl is 139 + 67 + 197 = 393.
- The number of Parrot is 197 + 41 + 67 + 248 = 543.
- The number of Eagle is 543 + 41 = **584**.

**Answer: 584**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as n; so n = 248. Define Crow as N; f = n = 248; so N = 289 + f = 289 + 248 = 537. Define Sparrow as m; l = N + n = 537 + 248 = 785; so m = 26 + l = 26 + 785 = 811. Define Hawk as h; v = m = 811; so h = 130 + v = 130 + 811 = 941. Define Parrot as w; i = h + N = 941 + 537 = 1478; D = i + m = 1478 + 811 = 2289; so w = D + n = 2289 + 248 = 2537. Define Eagle as r; so r = w + N = 2537 + 537 = 3074. Answer: 3074.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Tiger equals 540.
- The number of Lion equals 199 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Bear equals 365.
- The number of Wolf equals 38 plus the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals 744 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon equals 611 plus the number of Tiger.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate:
    - The number of Fox = Deer + Tiger = Deer + 540
    - The number of Deer = Wolf + Tiger = Wolf + 540
    - The number of Raccoon = 611 + Tiger

- Substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of Elephant, we get:
    - The number of Elephant = 744 + Fox = 744 + (Deer + 540) = 744 + (Wolf + 540) = 744 + (38 + Raccoon)
    - Therefore, the number of Elephant = 744 + 38 + 611 = 1193

**Answer: 1193**<eos>
Define Tiger as D; so D = 540. Define Raccoon as r; X = D = 540; so r = 611 + X = 611 + 540 = 1151. Define Lion as U; n = r + D = 1151 + 540 = 1691; so U = 199 + n = 199 + 1691 = 1890. Define Wolf as E; x = U + r = 1890 + 1151 = 3041; so E = 38 + x = 38 + 3041 = 3079. Define Deer as T; so T = E + D = 3079 + 540 = 3619. Define Fox as f; so f = T + D = 3619 + 540 = 4159. Define Elephant as G; m = f = 4159; so G = 744 + m = 744 + 4159 = 4903. Answer: 4903.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals the sum of the number of deer and the number of tiger.
- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of wolf and the number of tiger.
- the number of tiger equals 540.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 117 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 550 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Sparrow equals 222.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 439 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl as:
Number of Owl = 117 + Number of Sparrow
- We can also calculate the number of Crow as:
Number of Crow = Number of Blue Jay + Number of Sparrow + Number of Owl
- The number of Parrot can be calculated as:
Number of Parrot = Number of Crow + Number of Sparrow + Number of Blue Jay
- Finally, the number of Eagle can be calculated as:
Number of Eagle = 550 + Number of Parrot

**Answer:**

**Answer: 1027**<eos>
Define Sparrow as Z; so Z = 222. Define Owl as G; x = Z = 222; so G = 117 + x = 117 + 222 = 339. Define Blue Jay as X; E = G + Z = 339 + 222 = 561; so X = 439 + E = 439 + 561 = 1000. Define Crow as S; V = X + Z = 1000 + 222 = 1222; so S = V + G = 1222 + 339 = 1561. Define Parrot as b; f = S + Z = 1561 + 222 = 1783; so b = f + X = 1783 + 1000 = 2783. Define Eagle as D; C = b = 2783; so D = 550 + C = 550 + 2783 = 3333. Answer: 3333.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow is 412.
- The number of Eagle is the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 438 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 396 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Peacock equals the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 729 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Penguin.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Penguin, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Penguin is 518.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Eagle = number of Parrot + number of Owl
= 729 + (396 + number of Penguin)
= 729 + 396 + 518
= 1643
- The number of Crow = 438 + number of Eagle
= 438 + 1643
= 2081
- The number of Blue Jay = number of Crow
= 2081
- The number of Hawk = number of Blue Jay + number of Penguin + number of Eagle
= 2081 + 518 + 1643
= 4242

**Answer: 4242**<eos>
Define Penguin as F; so F = 518. Define Owl as S; Z = F = 518; so S = 396 + Z = 396 + 518 = 914. Define Parrot as M; x = S + F = 914 + 518 = 1432; so M = 729 + x = 729 + 1432 = 2161. Define Eagle as G; so G = M + S = 2161 + 914 = 3075. Define Crow as H; u = G = 3075; so H = 438 + u = 438 + 3075 = 3513. Define Blue Jay as D; so D = H = 3513. Define Hawk as s; t = D + F = 3513 + 518 = 4031; so s = t + G = 4031 + 3075 = 7106. Answer: 7106.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 606 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 641.
- The number of Wolf equals 128 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Bear equals 748 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 397 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Deer, and the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have: Fox = 606 + Deer
- From the second equation, we have: Deer = 641
- Substituting the value of Deer from the second equation into the first equation, we get: Fox = 606 + 641 = 1247
- From the third equation, we have: Wolf = 128 + Elephant
- From the fourth equation, we have: Bear = 748 + Fox + Deer
- Substituting the values of Fox and Deer from above equations, we get: Bear = 748 + 1247 + 641 = 2636
- From the fifth equation, we have: Raccoon = 397 + Bear
- Substituting the value of Bear from above equation, we get: Raccoon = 397 + 2636 = 2033
- From the sixth equation, we have: Elephant = Raccoon + Deer + Fox
- Substituting the values of Raccoon, Deer, and Fox from above equations, we get: Elephant = 2033 + 641 + 1247 = 3921

**Answer: 128 + 3921 = 4049**<eos>
Define Deer as e; so e = 641. Define Fox as t; B = e = 641; so t = 606 + B = 606 + 641 = 1247. Define Bear as p; S = t + e = 1247 + 641 = 1888; so p = 748 + S = 748 + 1888 = 2636. Define Raccoon as O; h = p = 2636; so O = 397 + h = 397 + 2636 = 3033. Define Elephant as R; A = O + e = 3033 + 641 = 3674; so R = A + t = 3674 + 1247 = 4921. Define Wolf as r; D = R = 4921; so r = 128 + D = 128 + 4921 = 5049. Answer: 5049.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 867.
- The number of Crow equals 513 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Sparrow, the number of Owl, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Crow, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 814 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Owl equals the number of Crow. Let's assume both are x.
- The number of Sparrow equals 814 plus the number of Blue Jay. So, the number of Sparrow is x + 814.
- The number of Crow equals 513 plus the number of Sparrow. Therefore, x = 513 + (x + 814).
- Solving for x, we get x = 1327.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Sparrow, the number of Owl, and the number of Blue Jay. So, the number of Eagle is 1327 + (x + 814) + x + 867 = 3018.

**Answer: 3018**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as o; so o = 867. Define Sparrow as V; x = o = 867; so V = 814 + x = 814 + 867 = 1681. Define Crow as D; n = V = 1681; so D = 513 + n = 513 + 1681 = 2194. Define Owl as M; so M = D = 2194. Define Parrot as L; J = M + D = 2194 + 2194 = 4388; so L = J + V = 4388 + 1681 = 6069. Define Eagle as s; m = L + V = 6069 + 1681 = 7750; E = m + M = 7750 + 2194 = 9944; so s = E + o = 9944 + 867 = 10811. Answer: 10811.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals the number of crow.
- the number of blue jay equals 867.
- the number of crow equals 513 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of parrot, the number of sparrow, the number of owl, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of parrot equals the sum of the number of owl, the number of crow, and the number of sparrow.
- the number of sparrow equals 814 plus the number of blue jay.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we know that the number of owl equals the number of crow. let's assume both are x.
- the number of sparrow equals 814 plus the number of blue jay. so, the number of sparrow is x + 814.
- the number of crow equals 513 plus the number of sparrow. therefore, x = 513 + (x + 814).
- solving for x, we get x = 1327.
- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of parrot, the number of sparrow, the number of owl, and the number of blue jay. so, the number of eagle is 1327 + (x + 814) + x + 867 = 3018.

- The number of Eagle equals the number of Hawk.

Substituting the values we get:

Number of Owl = 654 + 354 + 677 + 96 = 1771

**Answer: 1771**<eos>
Define Crow as K; so K = 677. Define Hawk as t; B = K = 677; so t = 96 + B = 96 + 677 = 773. Define Eagle as c; so c = t = 773. Define Blue Jay as J; h = c + K = 773 + 677 = 1450; o = h + t = 1450 + 773 = 2223; so J = 354 + o = 354 + 2223 = 2577. Define Sparrow as n; w = J = 2577; so n = 654 + w = 654 + 2577 = 3231. Define Owl as l; L = n + K = 3231 + 677 = 3908; so l = L + c = 3908 + 773 = 4681. Answer: 4681.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 115 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Deer, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 780 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Raccoon, the number of Fox, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 646.
- The number of Fox equals 309 plus the number of Raccoon.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the number of Wolf:**
Number of Wolf = 115 + (Number of Fox + Number of Deer + Number of Raccoon)
Number of Wolf = 115 + (309 + 646 + 780)
Number of Wolf = 115 + 1735
**Number of Wolf = 1840**

2. **Calculate the number of Raccoon:**
Number of Raccoon = 780 + Number of Deer
Number of Raccoon = 780 + 646
**Number of Raccoon = 1426**

3. **Calculate the number of Fox:**
Number of Fox = 309 + Number of Raccoon
Number of Fox = 309 + 1426
**Number of Fox = 1735**

4. **Calculate the number of Bear:**
Number of Bear = Number of Wolf + Number of Raccoon + Number of Fox + Number of Deer
Number of Bear = 1840 + 1426 + 1735 + 646
**Number of Bear = 5647**

**Answer: 5647**<eos>
Define Deer as y; so y = 646. Define Raccoon as G; l = y = 646; so G = 780 + l = 780 + 646 = 1426. Define Fox as A; I = G = 1426; so A = 309 + I = 309 + 1426 = 1735. Define Wolf as U; R = A + y = 1735 + 646 = 2381; z = R + G = 2381 + 1426 = 3807; so U = 115 + z = 115 + 3807 = 3922. Define Bear as C; f = U + G = 3922 + 1426 = 5348; i = f + A = 5348 + 1735 = 7083; so C = i + y = 7083 + 646 = 7729. Answer: 7729.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 115 plus the sum of the number of fox, the number of deer, and the number of raccoon.

- the number of bear equals the sum of the number of wolf, the number of raccoon, the number of fox, and the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 646.
- the number of fox equals 309 plus the number of raccoon.

**calculation:**

1. **calculate the number of wolf:**
number of wolf = 115 + (number of fox + number of deer + number of raccoon)
number of wolf = 115 + (309 + 646 + 780)
number of wolf = 115 + 1735
**number of wolf = 1840**

2. **calculate the number of raccoon:**
number of raccoon = 780 + number of deer
number of raccoon = 780 + 646
**number of raccoon = 1426**

3. **calculate the number of fox:**
number of fox = 309 + number of raccoon
number of fox = 309 + 1426
**number of fox = 1735**

4. **calculate the number of bear:**
number of bear = number of wolf + number of raccoon + number of fox + number of deer
number of bear = 1840 + 1426 + 1735 + 646

- The number of Wolf equals 240 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 882 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Horse and the number of Fox.
- The number of Elephant equals 830 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Horse equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 356 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Fox.
- The number of Lion equals 679.
- The number of Raccoon equals 21.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf equals 240 + the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 356 + the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Fox.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Horse and the number of Fox.
- The number of Horse equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 882 + the number of Lion.
- The number of Lion equals 679.

Substituting the above equations into each other, we get:

- The number of Elephant equals 830 + (240 + 356 + 679) = 830 + 1275 = 2105.

**Answer: 2105**<eos>
Define Lion as Q; so Q = 679. Define Fox as h; p = Q = 679; so h = 882 + p = 882 + 679 = 1561. Define Horse as H; so H = h = 1561. Define Tiger as g; so g = H + h = 1561 + 1561 = 3122. Define Bear as W; v = g + h = 3122 + 1561 = 4683; so W = 356 + v = 356 + 4683 = 5039. Define Wolf as D; V = W = 5039; so D = 240 + V = 240 + 5039 = 5279. Define Elephant as X; C = D = 5279; so X = 830 + C = 830 + 5279 = 6109. Answer: 6109.

- The number of Sparrow is 394 plus the number of Hawk.
- Therefore, the number of Hawk is 394 - the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Penguin is 27 + (394 - the number of Sparrow).
- The number of Owl is the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle is 581 plus the number of Penguin.
- Therefore, the number of Owl is the sum of the number of Parrot, 394 - the number of Sparrow, and 581 + the number of Penguin.

**Answer:**

**Answer: The number of Owl is the sum of the number of Parrot, 394 - the number of Sparrow, and 581 plus the number of Penguin.**<eos>
Define Hawk as h; so h = 591. Define Sparrow as e; V = h = 591; so e = 394 + V = 394 + 591 = 985. Define Penguin as U; X = e + h = 985 + 591 = 1576; so U = 27 + X = 27 + 1576 = 1603. Define Eagle as p; z = U = 1603; so p = 581 + z = 581 + 1603 = 2184. Define Parrot as v; l = p + h = 2184 + 591 = 2775; so v = l + U = 2775 + 1603 = 4378. Define Owl as y; r = v + e = 4378 + 985 = 5363; so y = r + p = 5363 + 2184 = 7547. Answer: 7547.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Lion equals 730 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 293 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Fox equals 818 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 986.
- The number of Raccoon equals 382.
- The number of Tiger equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 725 plus the number of Tiger.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Lion as:
Lion = 730 + Wolf + Elephant
- We also know that Elephant = Deer = 986.
- Substituting the value of Elephant into the equation for Lion, we get:
Lion = 730 + Wolf + 986
- Simplifying, we find:
Lion = 1716 + Wolf
- From the given information, we can also calculate the number of Bear as:
Bear = 293 + Lion
- Substituting the expression for Lion that we found earlier, we get:
Bear = 293 + 1716 + Wolf
- Simplifying, we find:
Bear = 2009 + Wolf

**Answer: Answer: 2009 + Wolf**<eos>
Define Deer as d; so d = 986. Define Elephant as p; so p = d = 986. Define Fox as x; H = p + d = 986 + 986 = 1972; so x = 818 + H = 818 + 1972 = 2790. Define Tiger as s; so s = x = 2790. Define Wolf as U; j = s = 2790; so U = 725 + j = 725 + 2790 = 3515. Define Lion as w; n = U + p = 3515 + 986 = 4501; so w = 730 + n = 730 + 4501 = 5231. Define Bear as h; T = w = 5231; so h = 293 + T = 293 + 5231 = 5524. Answer: 5524.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the number of Tiger.
- The number of Fox equals 226 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Wolf equals 4 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Tiger equals 439.
- The number of Elephant equals 35 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Raccoon equals 406 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Deer equals the number of Tiger. Let's assume both are x.
- The number of Fox is 226 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Tiger. Therefore, the number of Fox is 226 + x + x = 226 + 2x.
- The number of Wolf is 4 plus the number of Raccoon. Therefore, the number of Wolf is 4 + 406 + x = 410 + x.
- The number of Tiger is 439.
- The number of Elephant is 35 plus the number of Bear. Therefore, the number of Elephant is 35 + (410 + x) = 445 + x.

**Answer: 445 + x**<eos>
Define Tiger as D; so D = 439. Define Deer as U; so U = D = 439. Define Fox as x; N = U + D = 439 + 439 = 878; so x = 226 + N = 226 + 878 = 1104. Define Raccoon as d; b = x = 1104; so d = 406 + b = 406 + 1104 = 1510. Define Wolf as I; L = d = 1510; so I = 4 + L = 4 + 1510 = 1514. Define Bear as f; so f = I + U = 1514 + 439 = 1953. Define Elephant as S; Q = f = 1953; so S = 35 + Q = 35 + 1953 = 1988. Answer: 1988.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the number of tiger.
- the number of fox equals 226 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of tiger.
- the number of wolf equals 4 plus the number of raccoon.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 256 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 191 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals 848 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 87.
- The number of Sparrow equals 631 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Crow, and the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl:
Number of Owl = Number of Sparrow + Number of Crow + Number of Parrot
Number of Owl = 631 + 191 + 87
Number of Owl = 909

- We can then calculate the number of Blue Jay:
Number of Blue Jay = 256 + Number of Owl
Number of Blue Jay = 256 + 909
Number of Blue Jay = 1165

- Finally, we can calculate the number of Eagle:
Number of Eagle = 848 + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Owl
Number of Eagle = 848 + 1165 + 909
Number of Eagle = 2922

**Answer: 2922**<eos>
Define Parrot as f; so f = 87. Define Crow as A; t = f = 87; so A = 191 + t = 191 + 87 = 278. Define Sparrow as v; G = A + f = 278 + 87 = 365; so v = 631 + G = 631 + 365 = 996. Define Owl as X; O = v + A = 996 + 278 = 1274; so X = O + f = 1274 + 87 = 1361. Define Blue Jay as q; k = X = 1361; so q = 256 + k = 256 + 1361 = 1617. Define Eagle as I; l = q + X = 1617 + 1361 = 2978; so I = 848 + l = 848 + 2978 = 3826. Answer: 3826.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay equals 256 plus the number of owl.
- the number of crow equals 191 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of eagle equals 848 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of owl.
- the number of parrot equals 87.
- the number of sparrow equals 631 plus the sum of the number of crow and the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of sparrow, the number of crow, and the number of parrot.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of owl:
number of owl = number of sparrow + number of crow + number of parrot
number of owl = 631 + 191 + 87
number of owl = 909

- we can then calculate the number of blue jay:
number of blue jay = 256 + number of owl
number of blue jay = 256 + 909
number of blue jay = 1165

- finally, we can calculate the number of eagle:
number of eagle = 848 + number of blue jay + number of owl
number of eagle = 848 + 1165 + 909

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question!

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 658.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 113 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 194 plus the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 618 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Raccoon equals 769 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Elephant as follows:
Number of Elephant = Number of Raccoon + Number of Wolf
- We can also calculate the number of Fox as follows:
Number of Fox = 194 + (Number of Elephant + Number of Raccoon + Number of Wolf)
- Similarly, we can calculate the number of Raccoon as follows:
Number of Raccoon = 769 + (Number of Wolf + Number of Bear)
- Finally, we can calculate the number of Deer as follows:
Number of Deer = 113 + Number of Fox

**Answer:**

Answer: 230<eos>
Define Bear as O; so O = 658. Define Wolf as u; Z = O = 658; so u = 618 + Z = 618 + 658 = 1276. Define Raccoon as R; b = u + O = 1276 + 658 = 1934; so R = 769 + b = 769 + 1934 = 2703. Define Elephant as W; so W = R + u = 2703 + 1276 = 3979. Define Fox as d; j = W + R = 3979 + 2703 = 6682; t = j + u = 6682 + 1276 = 7958; so d = 194 + t = 194 + 7958 = 8152. Define Deer as G; m = d = 8152; so G = 113 + m = 113 + 8152 = 8265. Answer: 8265.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 658.
- the number of elephant equals the sum of the number of raccoon and the number of wolf.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Hawk equals 708.
- The number of Crow equals 777 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 471 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Sparrow equals 642 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Eagle equals 739 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 11 plus the number of Hawk.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Owl is the same as the number of Sparrow, which is 642.
- The number of Blue Jay is 11 plus the number of Hawk, which is 11 + 708 = 719.
- The number of Crow is 777 plus the number of Owl, which is 777 + 642 = 1419.
- The number of Sparrow is 642 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Hawk, which is 642 + 719 = 1361.
- The number of Eagle is 739 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Sparrow, which is 739 + 1419 + 1361 = 3519.

**Answer: 3519**<eos>
Define Hawk as S; so S = 708. Define Blue Jay as q; X = S = 708; so q = 11 + X = 11 + 708 = 719. Define Sparrow as L; j = q + S = 719 + 708 = 1427; so L = 642 + j = 642 + 1427 = 2069. Define Owl as E; so E = L = 2069. Define Crow as w; v = E = 2069; so w = 777 + v = 777 + 2069 = 2846. Define Eagle as D; z = w + E = 2846 + 2069 = 4915; A = z + L = 4915 + 2069 = 6984; so D = 739 + A = 739 + 6984 = 7723. Answer: 7723.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Bear, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals 927 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Bear.
- The number of Raccoon equals 593 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Elephant equals 405 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 272.
- The number of Wolf equals 296 plus the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Fox:
Number of Fox = Number of Deer + Number of Bear + Number of Raccoon
Number of Fox = 927 + 272 + 593
Number of Fox = 1792

- We can also calculate the number of Elephant:
Number of Elephant = 405 + Number of Fox
Number of Elephant = 405 + 1792
Number of Elephant = 2197

- Finally, we can calculate the number of Wolf:
Number of Wolf = 296 + Number of Elephant
Number of Wolf = 296 + 2197
Number of Wolf = 2493

**Answer: 2493**<eos>
Define Bear as h; so h = 272. Define Raccoon as d; M = h = 272; so d = 593 + M = 593 + 272 = 865. Define Deer as V; O = d + h = 865 + 272 = 1137; so V = 927 + O = 927 + 1137 = 2064. Define Fox as w; Z = V + h = 2064 + 272 = 2336; so w = Z + d = 2336 + 865 = 3201. Define Elephant as H; F = w = 3201; so H = 405 + F = 405 + 3201 = 3606. Define Wolf as g; i = H = 3606; so g = 296 + i = 296 + 3606 = 3902. Answer: 3902.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals 81 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 711.
- The number of Raccoon equals 740 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Deer equals 20 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 199 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Bear equals the number of Raccoon, which is 740.

**Answer: 740**<eos>
Define Wolf as P; so P = 711. Define Deer as r; T = P = 711; so r = 20 + T = 20 + 711 = 731. Define Fox as t; i = r + P = 731 + 711 = 1442; so t = 199 + i = 199 + 1442 = 1641. Define Elephant as e; O = t + P = 1641 + 711 = 2352; B = O + r = 2352 + 731 = 3083; so e = 81 + B = 81 + 3083 = 3164. Define Raccoon as u; G = e = 3164; so u = 740 + G = 740 + 3164 = 3904. Define Bear as o; so o = u = 3904. Answer: 3904.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals 374 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 528 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 455 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Bear.
- The number of Elephant equals 717 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 396.
- The number of Bear equals 240 plus the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Bear as follows:
Number of Bear = 240 + Number of Elephant
- We can also calculate the number of Raccoon as follows:
Number of Raccoon = 374 + Number of Fox + Number of Bear
- Similarly, we can calculate the number of Fox as follows:
Number of Fox = 528 + Number of Bear + Number of Wolf
- And the number of Deer as follows:
Number of Deer = 455 + Number of Raccoon + Number of Bear
- Substituting the values of Number of Bear and Number of Raccoon from above equations, we get:
Number of Deer = 455 + (374 + Number of Fox + Number of Bear) + Number of Bear
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
Number of Deer = 455 + 374 + Number of Fox + 2 * Number of Bear
- Substituting the value of Number of Wolf (396) for Number of Fox, we get:
Number of Deer = 455 + 374 + 396 + 2 * (240 + Number of Elephant)
- Combining like terms, we get:
Number of Deer = 1659 + 2 * Number of Elephant

**Answer: 1659 + 2 * Number of Elephant**<eos>
Define Wolf as w; so w = 396. Define Elephant as b; e = w = 396; so b = 717 + e = 717 + 396 = 1113. Define Bear as Q; g = b = 1113; so Q = 240 + g = 240 + 1113 = 1353. Define Fox as E; s = Q + w = 1353 + 396 = 1749; so E = 528 + s = 528 + 1749 = 2277. Define Raccoon as q; f = E + Q = 2277 + 1353 = 3630; so q = 374 + f = 374 + 3630 = 4004. Define Deer as X; N = q + Q = 4004 + 1353 = 5357; so X = 455 + N = 455 + 5357 = 5812. Answer: 5812.

- we can also calculate the number of raccoon as follows:
number of raccoon = 374 + number of fox + number of bear
- similarly, we can calculate the number of fox as follows:
number of fox = 528 + number of bear + number of wolf
- and the number of deer as follows:
number of deer = 455 + number of raccoon + number of bear
- substituting the values of number of bear and number of raccoon from above equations, we get:
number of deer = 455 + (374 + number of fox + number of bear) + number of bear
- simplifying the equation, we get:
number of deer = 455 + 374 + number of fox + 2 * number of bear
- substituting the value of number of wolf (396) for number of fox, we get:
number of deer = 455 + 374 + 396 + 2 * (240 + number of elephant)

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 941 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 357 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Eagle equals 988 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 432.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Owl, and the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Hawk as follows:
Number of Sparrow = 941 + Number of Hawk
Therefore, Number of Hawk = Number of Sparrow - 941.
- We can also calculate the number of Owl as follows:
Number of Owl = Number of Parrot
Therefore, Number of Owl = 357 + Number of Crow.
- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Parrot as follows:
Number of Parrot = 357 + Number of Crow
Therefore, Number of Crow = Number of Parrot - 357.
- We can calculate the number of Eagle as follows:
Number of Eagle = 988 + Number of Owl + Number of Crow
Therefore, Number of Eagle = 988 + (357 + Number of Crow) + Number of Crow.
- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Blue Jay as follows:
Number of Blue Jay = Number of Eagle + Number of Owl + Number of Parrot
Therefore, Number of Blue Jay = (988 + (357 + Number of Crow) + Number of Crow) + Number of Owl + Number of Parrot.
- We can calculate the number of Sparrow as follows:
Number of Sparrow = 941 + Number of Hawk
Therefore, Number of Sparrow = 941 + (Number of Sparrow - 941).

**Answer:**

Answer: 941<eos>
Define Crow as k; so k = 432. Define Parrot as K; z = k = 432; so K = 357 + z = 357 + 432 = 789. Define Owl as D; so D = K = 789. Define Eagle as B; e = D + k = 789 + 432 = 1221; so B = 988 + e = 988 + 1221 = 2209. Define Blue Jay as g; v = B + D = 2209 + 789 = 2998; so g = v + K = 2998 + 789 = 3787. Define Hawk as t; so t = g + D = 3787 + 789 = 4576. Define Sparrow as f; Z = t = 4576; so f = 941 + Z = 941 + 4576 = 5517. Answer: 5517.
**arguments:**

- the number of sparrow equals 941 plus the number of hawk.
- the number of owl equals the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 357 plus the number of crow.
- the number of eagle equals 988 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals 432.
- the number of hawk equals the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of owl.
- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of eagle, the number of owl, and the number of parrot.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of hawk as follows:
number of sparrow = 941 + number of hawk
therefore, number of hawk = number of sparrow - 941.
- we can also calculate the number of owl as follows:
number of owl = number of parrot
therefore, number of owl = 357 + number of crow.
- from the given information, we can calculate the number of parrot as follows:
number of parrot = 357 + number of crow
therefore, number of crow = number of parrot - 357.
- we can calculate the number of eagle as follows:
number of eagle = 988 + number of owl + number of crow
therefore, number of eagle = 988 + (357 + number of crow) + number of crow.
- from the given information, we can calculate the number of blue jay as follows:
number of blue jay = number of eagle + number of owl + number of parrot
therefore, number of blue jay = (988 + (357 + number of crow) + number of crow) + number of owl + number of parrot.
- we can calculate the number of sparrow as follows:
number of sparrow = 941 + number of hawk
therefore, number of sparrow = 941 + (number of sparrow - 941).

**Arguments:**

- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Bear, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Tiger equals 601 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 344 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Elephant, the number of Tiger, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals 617.
- The number of Wolf equals 677.
- The number of Elephant equals 791 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Raccoon equals 480 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox = 344 + Raccoon
- The number of Tiger = 601 + Fox
- The number of Lion = Bear + Raccoon + Tiger
- The number of Raccoon = 480 + Elephant + Bear
- The number of Elephant = 791 + Bear
- The number of Bear = 617

Substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of Lion, we get:

Number of Lion = 617 + 480 + (601 + 344 + Raccoon)
= 1442 + 945 + Raccoon
= 2387 + Raccoon

**Answer: 2387 + Raccoon**<eos>
Define Bear as a; so a = 617. Define Elephant as j; M = a = 617; so j = 791 + M = 791 + 617 = 1408. Define Raccoon as B; O = j + a = 1408 + 617 = 2025; so B = 480 + O = 480 + 2025 = 2505. Define Fox as d; V = B = 2505; so d = 344 + V = 344 + 2505 = 2849. Define Tiger as G; k = d = 2849; so G = 601 + k = 601 + 2849 = 3450. Define Lion as i; P = G + a = 3450 + 617 = 4067; so i = P + B = 4067 + 2505 = 6572. Answer: 6572.
**arguments:**

- the number of lion equals the sum of the number of tiger, the number of bear, and the number of raccoon.
- the number of tiger equals 601 plus the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 344 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of fox, the number of elephant, the number of tiger, and the number of raccoon.
- the number of bear equals 617.
- the number of wolf equals 677.
- the number of elephant equals 791 plus the number of bear.
- the number of raccoon equals 480 plus the sum of the number of elephant and the number of bear.

**calculation:**

- the number of fox = 344 + raccoon
- the number of tiger = 601 + fox
- the number of lion = bear + raccoon + tiger
- the number of raccoon = 480 + elephant + bear
- the number of elephant = 791 + bear
- the number of bear = 617

substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of lion, we get:

number of lion = 617 + 480 + (601 + 344 + raccoon)
= 1442 + 945 + raccoon
= 2387 + raccoon

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Owl equals 329 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Sparrow equals 875.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 375 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 293 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Crow.
- The number of Eagle equals 932 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Crow equals the number of Sparrow, so let's assume both are x.
- The number of Owl equals 329 plus the number of Eagle, so we can write: Number of Owl = 329 + y, where y is the number of Eagle.
- The number of Sparrow equals 875, so we have: x = 875.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Crow, so we have: x = Hawk.
- The number of Parrot equals 375 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Sparrow, so we can write: Number of Parrot = 375 + x + Hawk.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 293 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Crow, so we have: Number of Blue Jay = 293 + (375 + x + Hawk) + x.
- The number of Eagle equals 932 plus the number of Blue Jay, so we have: y = 932 + Number of Blue Jay.

**Answer:**

Number of Owl = 329 + y = 329 + (932 + Number of Blue Jay) = 329 + 932 + 875 = **1136**<eos>
Define Sparrow as x; so x = 875. Define Crow as e; so e = x = 875. Define Hawk as P; so P = e = 875. Define Parrot as N; D = P + x = 875 + 875 = 1750; so N = 375 + D = 375 + 1750 = 2125. Define Blue Jay as U; b = N + e = 2125 + 875 = 3000; so U = 293 + b = 293 + 3000 = 3293. Define Eagle as I; Y = U = 3293; so I = 932 + Y = 932 + 3293 = 4225. Define Owl as u; K = I = 4225; so u = 329 + K = 329 + 4225 = 4554. Answer: 4554.
**arguments:**

- the number of crow equals the number of sparrow.
- the number of owl equals 329 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of sparrow equals 875.

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 689.
- The number of Raccoon equals 453 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Wolf equals the number of Raccoon, which we can denote as x.
- The number of Deer is 893 + x.
- The number of Lion is x + Fox + Raccoon + Tiger.
- The number of Tiger is 389 + Elephant + Fox + Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant is 487 + Deer.
- The number of Horse is 703 + Bear + Tiger + Wolf.
- The number of Bear is Deer + Wolf.
- The number of Fox is 689.
- The number of Raccoon is 453 + Fox.

**Solving for Tiger:**

From the equations above, we can solve for Tiger:

Tiger = 389 + Elephant + Fox + Raccoon
Tiger = 389 + (487 + Deer) + 689 + (453 + Fox)
Tiger = 389 + 487 + Deer + 689 + 453 + Fox
Tiger = 1918 + Deer + Fox

**Answer:**

**Answer: 1918 + Deer + Fox**<eos>
Define Fox as e; so e = 689. Define Raccoon as n; W = e = 689; so n = 453 + W = 453 + 689 = 1142. Define Wolf as B; so B = n = 1142. Define Deer as o; f = B + n = 1142 + 1142 = 2284; so o = 893 + f = 893 + 2284 = 3177. Define Elephant as k; g = o = 3177; so k = 487 + g = 487 + 3177 = 3664. Define Tiger as S; u = k + e = 3664 + 689 = 4353; A = u + n = 4353 + 1142 = 5495; so S = 389 + A = 389 + 5495 = 5884. Answer: 5884.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals 982 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals 95 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Lion equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals 605.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 801.
- The number of Wolf equals 425 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals 563 plus the number of Lion.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon is 605 (given).
- The number of Deer is 95 plus the number of Bear, so the number of Deer is 95 + 605 = 690.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer, so the number of Wolf is Raccoon - Deer = 605 - 690 = -85. Since the number of Wolf cannot be negative, we assume the number of Wolf is 0.
- The number of Tiger equals 982 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Raccoon, so the number of Tiger is 982 + (563 + 0) = 1545.

**Answer: 1545**<eos>
Define Bear as x; so x = 605. Define Deer as P; l = x = 605; so P = 95 + l = 95 + 605 = 700. Define Wolf as C; S = P = 700; so C = 425 + S = 425 + 700 = 1125. Define Raccoon as q; so q = C + P = 1125 + 700 = 1825. Define Lion as T; so T = q = 1825. Define Fox as u; w = T = 1825; so u = 563 + w = 563 + 1825 = 2388. Define Tiger as g; U = u + q = 2388 + 1825 = 4213; so g = 982 + U = 982 + 4213 = 5195. Answer: 5195.
**arguments:**

- the number of tiger equals 982 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of raccoon.
- the number of deer equals 95 plus the number of bear.
- the number of lion equals the number of raccoon.
- the number of bear equals 605.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 289 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 468.
- The number of Eagle equals 154 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Crow, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 964 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Hawk as follows:
  Hawk = Sparrow + Crow + Owl = 289 + Crow + Owl
- We can also calculate the number of Owl as follows:
  Owl = Parrot = 468
- Substituting the value of Owl into the equation for Hawk, we get:
  Hawk = 289 + Crow + 468 = 757 + Crow
- From the given information, we can also calculate the number of Crow as follows:
  Crow = Owl + Parrot = 468 + Parrot
- Substituting the value of Crow into the equation for Hawk, we get:
  Hawk = 757 + (468 + Parrot) = 1225 + Parrot
- Finally, we can calculate the number of Blue Jay as follows:
  Blue Jay = 964 + Eagle = 964 + (1225 + Parrot) = 2189 + Parrot

**Answer: 2189 + Parrot**<eos>
Define Parrot as c; so c = 468. Define Owl as B; so B = c = 468. Define Crow as d; so d = B + c = 468 + 468 = 936. Define Sparrow as a; k = d + B = 936 + 468 = 1404; so a = 289 + k = 289 + 1404 = 1693. Define Hawk as Q; M = a + d = 1693 + 936 = 2629; so Q = M + B = 2629 + 468 = 3097. Define Eagle as X; t = Q = 3097; so X = 154 + t = 154 + 3097 = 3251. Define Blue Jay as h; p = X = 3251; so h = 964 + p = 964 + 3251 = 4215. Answer: 4215.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 254 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Hawk equals 664 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 63 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 901.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Hawk = 664 + (Sparrow + Parrot)
- The number of Sparrow = Crow + Blue Jay = Crow + 901
- The number of Parrot = 63 + Eagle
- The number of Owl = 254 + Hawk
- Substituting the above equations into each other, we get:
  - The number of Owl = 254 + 664 + (Sparrow + Parrot) - Blue Jay
  - The number of Owl = 254 + 664 + (Crow + 901) - 901
  - The number of Owl = 918 + Crow

**Answer: 918 + Crow**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as R; so R = 901. Define Eagle as k; C = R = 901; so k = 368 + C = 368 + 901 = 1269. Define Parrot as E; t = k = 1269; so E = 63 + t = 63 + 1269 = 1332. Define Crow as p; so p = E + R = 1332 + 901 = 2233. Define Sparrow as D; so D = p + R = 2233 + 901 = 3134. Define Hawk as g; A = D + E = 3134 + 1332 = 4466; so g = 664 + A = 664 + 4466 = 5130. Define Owl as d; x = g + R = 5130 + 901 = 6031; so d = 254 + x = 254 + 6031 = 6285. Answer: 6285.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 168.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 202 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Eagle equals 713 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals 953 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow equals 503 plus the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Owl = Number of Blue Jay + Number of Sparrow
= 202 + 168
= 370
- The number of Eagle = 713 + (Number of Crow + Number of Owl + Number of Blue Jay)
= 713 + (503 + 370 + 202)
= 1687
- The number of Parrot = 953 + Number of Eagle
= 953 + 1687
= 2640

**Answer: 2640**<eos>
Define Sparrow as i; so i = 168. Define Blue Jay as C; M = i = 168; so C = 202 + M = 202 + 168 = 370. Define Owl as b; so b = C + i = 370 + 168 = 538. Define Crow as Y; s = b = 538; so Y = 503 + s = 503 + 538 = 1041. Define Eagle as e; j = Y + b = 1041 + 538 = 1579; m = j + C = 1579 + 370 = 1949; so e = 713 + m = 713 + 1949 = 2662. Define Parrot as O; Q = e = 2662; so O = 953 + Q = 953 + 2662 = 3615. Answer: 3615.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of sparrow.
- the number of sparrow equals 168.
- the number of blue jay equals 202 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of eagle equals 713 plus the sum of the number of crow, the number of owl, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of parrot equals 953 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of crow equals 503 plus the number of owl.

**calculation:**

- the number of owl = number of blue jay + number of sparrow
= 202 + 168
= 370
- the number of eagle = 713 + (number of crow + number of owl + number of blue jay)
= 713 + (503 + 370 + 202)
= 1687
- the number of parrot = 953 + number of eagle
= 953 + 1687
= 2640

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 502 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Raccoon, the number of Wolf, and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Bear equals 696.
- The number of Elephant equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals 314 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Tiger equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals 372 plus the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon is 372 plus the number of Bear, so the number of Raccoon is 372 + x, where x is the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox is 314 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Raccoon, so the number of Fox is 314 + (x + y), where y is the number of Tiger.
- The number of Wolf is 502 plus the number of Raccoon, so the number of Wolf is 502 + x.
- The number of Deer is the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Raccoon, the number of Wolf, and the number of Tiger, so the number of Deer is (314 + (x + y)) + (372 + x) + (502 + x) + y.
- The number of Elephant is the number of Deer, so the number of Elephant is (314 + (x + y)) + (372 + x) + (502 + x) + y.

**Answer:**

Answer: (314 + (x + y)) + (372 + x) + (502 + x) + y<eos>
Define Bear as z; so z = 696. Define Raccoon as d; B = z = 696; so d = 372 + B = 372 + 696 = 1068. Define Wolf as W; F = d = 1068; so W = 502 + F = 502 + 1068 = 1570. Define Tiger as E; so E = W = 1570. Define Fox as f; K = E + d = 1570 + 1068 = 2638; so f = 314 + K = 314 + 2638 = 2952. Define Deer as t; a = f + d = 2952 + 1068 = 4020; S = a + W = 4020 + 1570 = 5590; so t = S + E = 5590 + 1570 = 7160. Answer: 7160.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 502 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of fox, the number of raccoon, the number of wolf, and the number of tiger.
- the number of bear equals 696.
- the number of elephant equals the number of deer.
- the number of fox equals 314 plus the sum of the number of tiger and the number of raccoon.
- the number of tiger equals the number of wolf.
- the number of raccoon equals 372 plus the number of bear.

**calculation:**

- the number of raccoon is 372 plus the number of bear, so the number of raccoon is 372 + x, where x is the number of bear.
- the number of fox is 314 plus the sum of the number of tiger and the number of raccoon, so the number of fox is 314 + (x + y), where y is the number of tiger.
- the number of wolf is 502 plus the number of raccoon, so the number of wolf is 502 + x.
- the number of deer is the sum of the number of fox, the number of raccoon, the number of wolf, and the number of tiger, so the number of deer is (314 + (x + y)) + (372 + x) + (502 + x) + y.
- the number of elephant is the number of deer, so the number of elephant is (314 + (x + y)) + (372 + x) + (502 + x) + y.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 320 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Tiger equals 680 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Elephant equals the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Tiger, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Elephant, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 252.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Deer as:
Number of Deer = Number of Wolf + Number of Tiger
- We can also calculate the number of Fox as:
Number of Fox = 320 + Number of Deer
- Substituting the expression for Number of Deer from the previous step, we get:
Number of Fox = 320 + (Number of Wolf + Number of Tiger)
- We can calculate the number of Tiger as:
Number of Tiger = Number of Elephant - Number of Bear
- Substituting this expression for Number of Tiger, we get:
Number of Fox = 320 + (Number of Wolf + (Number of Elephant - Number of Bear))
- We can calculate the number of Wolf as:
Number of Wolf = Number of Raccoon + Number of Tiger + Number of Elephant
- Substituting this expression for Number of Wolf, we get:
Number of Fox = 320 + (Number of Raccoon + Number of Tiger + Number of Elephant + (Number of Elephant - Number of Bear))
- Simplifying, we get:
Number of Fox = 320 + (Number of Raccoon + 2 * Number of Elephant - Number of Bear)

**Answer:**

Answer: 320 + (Number of Raccoon + 2 * Number of Elephant - Number of Bear)<eos>
Define Bear as v; so v = 252. Define Elephant as M; so M = v = 252. Define Tiger as C; u = M = 252; so C = 680 + u = 680 + 252 = 932. Define Raccoon as B; L = C + M = 932 + 252 = 1184; so B = L + v = 1184 + 252 = 1436. Define Wolf as d; a = B + C = 1436 + 932 = 2368; so d = a + M = 2368 + 252 = 2620. Define Deer as p; so p = d + C = 2620 + 932 = 3552. Define Fox as z; N = p = 3552; so z = 320 + N = 320 + 3552 = 3872. Answer: 3872.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals 320 plus the number of deer.
- the number of tiger equals 680 plus the number of elephant.
- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of wolf and the number of tiger.
- the number of elephant equals the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of raccoon, the number of tiger, and the number of elephant.
- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of tiger, the number of elephant, and the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 252.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of deer as:
number of deer = number of wolf + number of tiger
- we can also calculate the number of fox as:
number of fox = 320 + number of deer
- substituting the expression for number of deer from the previous step, we get:
number of fox = 320 + (number of wolf + number of tiger)
- we can calculate the number of tiger as:
number of tiger = number of elephant - number of bear
- substituting this expression for number of tiger, we get:
number of fox = 320 + (number of wolf + (number of elephant - number of bear))
- we can calculate the number of wolf as:
number of wolf = number of raccoon + number of tiger + number of elephant
- substituting this expression for number of wolf, we get:
number of fox = 320 + (number of raccoon + number of tiger + number of elephant + (number of elephant - number of bear))
- simplifying, we get:
number of fox = 320 + (number of raccoon + 2 * number of elephant - number of bear)

**answer:**

answer: 320 + (number of raccoon + 2 * number of elephant - number of bear)<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 239 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Bear equals 134.
- The number of Elephant equals 925 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 203.
- The number of Raccoon equals 602 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Deer equals 118 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox = 239 + (Elephant + Wolf) = 239 + (925 + 203) = 239 + 1128 = 1367.
- The number of Tiger = Fox + Wolf + Elephant = 1367 + 203 + 925 = 2495.
- The number of Raccoon = 602 + Tiger = 602 + 2495 = 3097.
- The number of Deer = 118 + (Raccoon + Elephant) = 118 + (3097 + 925) = 118 + 1222 = 1340.

**Answer: 1340**<eos>
Define Wolf as l; so l = 203. Define Elephant as H; g = l = 203; so H = 925 + g = 925 + 203 = 1128. Define Fox as S; x = H + l = 1128 + 203 = 1331; so S = 239 + x = 239 + 1331 = 1570. Define Tiger as N; f = S + l = 1570 + 203 = 1773; so N = f + H = 1773 + 1128 = 2901. Define Raccoon as b; D = N = 2901; so b = 602 + D = 602 + 2901 = 3503. Define Deer as Z; k = b + H = 3503 + 1128 = 4631; so Z = 118 + k = 118 + 4631 = 4749. Answer: 4749.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 29 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 783.
- The number of Bear equals 29 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals 125 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Elephant equals 757 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 571 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox is 783.
- The number of Deer is 29 plus the number of Fox, so the number of Deer is 29 + 783 = 812.
- The number of Bear is 29 plus the number of Wolf, so the number of Bear is 29 + 571 = 600.
- The number of Raccoon is 125 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox, so the number of Raccoon is 125 + (812 + 783) = 2810.
- The number of Elephant is 757 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer, so the number of Elephant is 757 + (600 + 812) = 2169.

**Answer: 2169**<eos>
Define Fox as D; so D = 783. Define Deer as Y; J = D = 783; so Y = 29 + J = 29 + 783 = 812. Define Raccoon as S; e = Y + D = 812 + 783 = 1595; so S = 125 + e = 125 + 1595 = 1720. Define Wolf as B; s = S + Y = 1720 + 812 = 2532; so B = 571 + s = 571 + 2532 = 3103. Define Bear as o; R = B = 3103; so o = 29 + R = 29 + 3103 = 3132. Define Elephant as L; i = o + Y = 3132 + 812 = 3944; so L = 757 + i = 757 + 3944 = 4701. Answer: 4701.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals 261 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Bear, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Wolf equals 26.
- The number of Elephant equals 958 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 942 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Deer = Bear + Raccoon + Wolf = Elephant + Raccoon + Wolf = 958 + 942 + 26 = 1926.
- The number of Fox = 261 + Deer + Bear + Raccoon = 261 + 1926 + Elephant + Raccoon = 261 + 1926 + 958 + 942 = 5457.

**Answer: 5457**<eos>
Define Wolf as z; so z = 26. Define Raccoon as x; Y = z = 26; so x = 942 + Y = 942 + 26 = 968. Define Elephant as a; X = x = 968; so a = 958 + X = 958 + 968 = 1926. Define Bear as p; so p = a = 1926. Define Deer as N; V = p + x = 1926 + 968 = 2894; so N = V + z = 2894 + 26 = 2920. Define Fox as d; J = N + p = 2920 + 1926 = 4846; D = J + x = 4846 + 968 = 5814; so d = 261 + D = 261 + 5814 = 6075. Answer: 6075.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of bear, the number of raccoon, and the number of wolf.
- the number of bear equals the number of elephant.
- the number of fox equals 261 plus the sum of the number of deer, the number of bear, and the number of raccoon.
- the number of wolf equals 26.
- the number of elephant equals 958 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of raccoon equals 942 plus the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- the number of deer = bear + raccoon + wolf = elephant + raccoon + wolf = 958 + 942 + 26 = 1926.
- the number of fox = 261 + deer + bear + raccoon = 261 + 1926 + elephant + raccoon = 261 + 1926 + 958 + 942 = 5457.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, the number of Crow, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 956 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals 32 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 426.
- The number of Sparrow equals 960 plus the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, the number of Crow, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 956 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals 32 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 426.
- The number of Sparrow equals 960 plus the number of Parrot.

Substituting the values we get:

- The number of Blue Jay = Owl + Eagle + Crow + Parrot
- The number of Blue Jay = Owl + 32 + 956 + 426
- The number of Blue Jay = Owl + 1294

Since the number of Owl equals the number of Eagle, we can write:

- The number of Blue Jay = 2 * Owl + 1294

Therefore, the number of Blue Jay is **2 * Owl + 1294**.<eos>
Define Parrot as R; so R = 426. Define Sparrow as Y; o = R = 426; so Y = 960 + o = 960 + 426 = 1386. Define Crow as h; n = Y + R = 1386 + 426 = 1812; so h = 956 + n = 956 + 1812 = 2768. Define Eagle as a; I = h = 2768; so a = 32 + I = 32 + 2768 = 2800. Define Owl as W; so W = a = 2800. Define Blue Jay as b; v = W + a = 2800 + 2800 = 5600; u = v + h = 5600 + 2768 = 8368; so b = u + R = 8368 + 426 = 8794. Answer: 8794.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of owl, the number of eagle, the number of crow, and the number of parrot.
- the number of crow equals 956 plus the sum of the number of sparrow and the number of parrot.
- the number of eagle equals 32 plus the number of crow.
- the number of owl equals the number of eagle.
- the number of parrot equals 426.
- the number of sparrow equals 960 plus the number of parrot.

**calculation:**

- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of owl, the number of eagle, the number of crow, and the number of parrot.
- the number of crow equals 956 plus the sum of the number of sparrow and the number of parrot.
- the number of eagle equals 32 plus the number of crow.
- the number of owl equals the number of eagle.
- the number of parrot equals 426.
- the number of sparrow equals 960 plus the number of parrot.

substituting the values we get:

- the number of blue jay = owl + eagle + crow + parrot
- the number of blue jay = owl + 32 + 956 + 426
- the number of blue jay = owl + 1294

since the number of owl equals the number of eagle, we can write:

- the number of blue jay = 2 * owl + 1294

therefore, the number of blue jay is **2 * owl + 1294**.<eos>

- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 132 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 171 plus the number of Crow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Sparrow is 774 + (Owl + Crow + Parrot) = 774 + (132 + 171 + 19) = 1226.
- The number of Eagle is 503 + Sparrow = 503 + 1226 = 1729.
- The number of Blue Jay is Eagle + Owl = 1729 + 132 = 1861.

**Answer: 1861**<eos>
Define Crow as j; so j = 19. Define Parrot as t; P = j = 19; so t = 171 + P = 171 + 19 = 190. Define Owl as X; D = t = 190; so X = 132 + D = 132 + 190 = 322. Define Sparrow as v; p = X + j = 322 + 19 = 341; E = p + t = 341 + 190 = 531; so v = 774 + E = 774 + 531 = 1305. Define Eagle as n; o = v = 1305; so n = 503 + o = 503 + 1305 = 1808. Define Blue Jay as N; so N = n + X = 1808 + 322 = 2130. Answer: 2130.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Hawk equals the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 276 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 237 plus the sum of the number of Penguin, the number of Eagle, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Penguin equals 784 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 788 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 896.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Sparrow = 237 + (784 + 788 + 896) = 237 + 2458 = 2695.
- The number of Hawk = the number of Crow = 276 + 2695 = 3071.

**Answer: 3071**<eos>
Define Eagle as W; so W = 896. Define Owl as J; l = W = 896; so J = 788 + l = 788 + 896 = 1684. Define Penguin as F; x = J = 1684; so F = 784 + x = 784 + 1684 = 2468. Define Sparrow as w; X = F + W = 2468 + 896 = 3364; P = X + J = 3364 + 1684 = 5048; so w = 237 + P = 237 + 5048 = 5285. Define Crow as f; C = w = 5285; so f = 276 + C = 276 + 5285 = 5561. Define Hawk as e; so e = f = 5561. Answer: 5561.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 154 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 12 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 588 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 750 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = 12 + (Number of Owl + Number of Eagle)
- We can also calculate the number of Owl as:
Number of Owl = 588 + Number of Crow
- Substituting the above equation into the equation for Sparrow, we get:
Number of Sparrow = 12 + (588 + Number of Crow + Number of Eagle)
- Rearranging the equation, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 154 + Number of Sparrow - Number of Eagle
- Substituting the equation for Sparrow, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 154 + (12 + (588 + Number of Crow + Number of Eagle)) - Number of Eagle
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 154 + 590 + Number of Crow + Number of Eagle - Number of Eagle
- Combining like terms, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 744 + Number of Crow

**Answer: 744**<eos>
Define Eagle as o; so o = 75. Define Parrot as d; m = o = 75; so d = 312 + m = 312 + 75 = 387. Define Crow as r; P = d + o = 387 + 75 = 462; so r = 750 + P = 750 + 462 = 1212. Define Owl as N; O = r = 1212; so N = 588 + O = 588 + 1212 = 1800. Define Sparrow as q; I = N + o = 1800 + 75 = 1875; so q = 12 + I = 12 + 1875 = 1887. Define Blue Jay as e; u = q = 1887; so e = 154 + u = 154 + 1887 = 2041. Answer: 2041.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay equals 154 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of sparrow equals 12 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals 588 plus the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals 750 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of sparrow as:
number of sparrow = 12 + (number of owl + number of eagle)
- we can also calculate the number of owl as:
number of owl = 588 + number of crow
- substituting the above equation into the equation for sparrow, we get:
number of sparrow = 12 + (588 + number of crow + number of eagle)
- rearranging the equation, we get:
number of blue jay = 154 + number of sparrow - number of eagle
- substituting the equation for sparrow, we get:
number of blue jay = 154 + (12 + (588 + number of crow + number of eagle)) - number of eagle
- simplifying the equation, we get:
number of blue jay = 154 + 590 + number of crow + number of eagle - number of eagle
- combining like terms, we get:
number of blue jay = 744 + number of crow

**answer: 744**<eos>

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated. Problem: The number of Eagle equals the number of Parrot.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 342 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 142 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 547 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Crow.
- The number of Hawk equals 490 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Crow.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Eagle equals the number of Parrot. Therefore, let's assume x as the number of Eagle and Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 342 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Owl. So, we have: x = 342 + BJ + O, where BJ is the number of Blue Jay and O is the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 142 plus the number of Sparrow. So, we have: C = 142 + S, where S is the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 547 plus the number of Owl. So, we have: S = 547 + O.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Crow. So, we have: BJ = C.
- The number of Hawk equals 490 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Crow. So, we have: H = 490 + x + C.

**Substituting the expressions for x, C, and BJ from the previous equations, we get:**

H = 490 + (342 + BJ + O) + C
H = 490 + (342 + C + O) + C
H = 490 + 342 + 2C + O
H = 832 + 2C + O

**Since the number of Owl equals 544, we can substitute this value for O:**

H = 832 + 2C + 544
H = 1376 + 2C

**Therefore, the number of Hawk is 1376 + 2C.**

**Answer: 1376 + 2C**<eos>
Define Owl as b; so b = 544. Define Sparrow as T; L = b = 544; so T = 547 + L = 547 + 544 = 1091. Define Crow as N; Q = T = 1091; so N = 142 + Q = 142 + 1091 = 1233. Define Blue Jay as X; so X = N = 1233. Define Parrot as e; w = X + b = 1233 + 544 = 1777; so e = 342 + w = 342 + 1777 = 2119. Define Eagle as s; so s = e = 2119. Define Hawk as Z; l = s + N = 2119 + 1233 = 3352; so Z = 490 + l = 490 + 3352 = 3842. Answer: 3842.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 342 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of owl.
- the number of crow equals 142 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of sparrow equals 547 plus the number of owl.
- the number of blue jay equals the number of crow.
- the number of hawk equals 490 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of crow.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we know that the number of eagle equals the number of parrot. therefore, let's assume x as the number of eagle and parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 342 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of owl. so, we have: x = 342 + bj + o, where bj is the number of blue jay and o is the number of owl.
- the number of crow equals 142 plus the number of sparrow. so, we have: c = 142 + s, where s is the number of sparrow.
- the number of sparrow equals 547 plus the number of owl. so, we have: s = 547 + o.
- the number of blue jay equals the number of crow. so, we have: bj = c.
- the number of hawk equals 490 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of crow. so, we have: h = 490 + x + c.

**substituting the expressions for x, c, and bj from the previous equations, we get:**

h = 490 + (342 + bj + o) + c
h = 490 + (342 + c + o) + c
h = 490 + 342 + 2c + o
h = 832 + 2c + o

**since the number of owl equals 544, we can substitute this value for o:**

h = 832 + 2c + 544
h = 1376 + 2c

**therefore, the number of hawk is 1376 + 2c.**

**answer: 1376 + 2c**<eos>

- The number of Hawk is 792 + 745 = 1537.
- The number of Penguin is 139 + 1537 = 1676.

**Answer: 1676**<eos>
Define Parrot as f; so f = 196. Define Blue Jay as X; J = f = 196; so X = 275 + J = 275 + 196 = 471. Define Eagle as C; so C = X + f = 471 + 196 = 667. Define Owl as F; B = C = 667; so F = 549 + B = 549 + 667 = 1216. Define Crow as m; so m = F + f = 1216 + 196 = 1412. Define Hawk as O; P = m + C = 1412 + 667 = 2079; so O = 792 + P = 792 + 2079 = 2871. Define Penguin as E; I = O = 2871; so E = 139 + I = 139 + 2871 = 3010. Answer: 3010.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 997 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Elephant equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 522.
- The number of Raccoon equals 498 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Elephant, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 675 plus the number of Raccoon.

**Calculation:**

1. From the given information, we can calculate the number of Bear:
Number of Bear = Number of Deer + Number of Elephant + Number of Raccoon + Number of Fox
Number of Bear = 675 + Number of Elephant + 498 + 522
Number of Bear = 1695 + Number of Elephant

2. From the first sentence, we can write:
Number of Wolf = 997 + Number of Bear
Number of Wolf = 997 + (1695 + Number of Elephant)
Number of Wolf = 2692 + Number of Elephant

**Answer: 2692 + Number of Elephant**<eos>
Define Fox as K; so K = 522. Define Elephant as X; so X = K = 522. Define Raccoon as Z; x = X = 522; so Z = 498 + x = 498 + 522 = 1020. Define Deer as N; L = Z = 1020; so N = 675 + L = 675 + 1020 = 1695. Define Bear as I; V = N + X = 1695 + 522 = 2217; y = V + Z = 2217 + 1020 = 3237; so I = y + K = 3237 + 522 = 3759. Define Wolf as C; b = I = 3759; so C = 997 + b = 997 + 3759 = 4756. Answer: 4756.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 997 plus the number of bear.
- the number of elephant equals the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 522.
- the number of raccoon equals 498 plus the number of elephant.
- the number of bear equals the sum of the number of deer, the number of elephant, the number of raccoon, and the number of fox.
- the number of deer equals 675 plus the number of raccoon.

**calculation:**

1. from the given information, we can calculate the number of bear:
number of bear = number of deer + number of elephant + number of raccoon + number of fox
number of bear = 675 + number of elephant + 498 + 522
number of bear = 1695 + number of elephant

2. from the first sentence, we can write:
number of wolf = 997 + number of bear
number of wolf = 997 + (1695 + number of elephant)
number of wolf = 2692 + number of elephant

**answer: 2692 + number of elephant**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Lion, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Fox equals 306 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 644.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Bear, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Lion equals 468 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 607 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear = Wolf + Lion + Raccoon = Wolf + 468 + 644 = Wolf + 1112.
- The number of Tiger = Bear + Wolf = (Wolf + 1112) + Wolf = 2 * Wolf + 1112.
- The number of Wolf = Deer = 607.
- Therefore, the number of Tiger = 2 * 607 + 1112 = 2234.

**Answer: 2234**<eos>
Define Raccoon as m; so m = 644. Define Fox as L; U = m = 644; so L = 306 + U = 306 + 644 = 950. Define Lion as M; Z = L = 950; so M = 468 + Z = 468 + 950 = 1418. Define Deer as c; X = M = 1418; so c = 607 + X = 607 + 1418 = 2025. Define Wolf as t; so t = c = 2025. Define Bear as Y; S = t + M = 2025 + 1418 = 3443; so Y = S + m = 3443 + 644 = 4087. Define Tiger as g; so g = Y + t = 4087 + 2025 = 6112. Answer: 6112.

- the number of tiger equals the sum of the number of bear and the number of wolf.
- the number of deer equals 607 plus the number of lion.
- the number of wolf equals the number of deer.

**calculation:**

- the number of bear = wolf + lion + raccoon = wolf + 468 + 644 = wolf + 1112.
- the number of tiger = bear + wolf = (wolf + 1112) + wolf = 2 * wolf + 1112.
- the number of wolf = deer = 607.
- therefore, the number of tiger = 2 * 607 + 1112 = 2234.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Deer, the number of Bear, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals 245 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 335.
- The number of Elephant equals 829 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 760 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the number of Bear:**
   - The number of Bear equals 245 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Raccoon.
   - The number of Deer equals 760 plus the number of Raccoon.
   - Therefore, the number of Bear equals 245 + (760 + 335) = 245 + 1095 = 1340.

2. **Calculate the number of Elephant:**
   - The number of Elephant equals 829 plus the number of Bear.
   - Therefore, the number of Elephant equals 829 + 1340 = 2169.

3. **Calculate the number of Fox:**
   - The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Deer, the number of Bear, and the number of Raccoon.
   - Therefore, the number of Fox equals 2169 + 760 + 1340 + 335 = 4504.

4. **Calculate the number of Wolf:**
   - The number of Wolf equals the number of Fox.
   - Therefore, the number of Wolf equals 4504.

**Answer: 4504**<eos>
Define Raccoon as X; so X = 335. Define Deer as h; f = X = 335; so h = 760 + f = 760 + 335 = 1095. Define Bear as A; B = h + X = 1095 + 335 = 1430; so A = 245 + B = 245 + 1430 = 1675. Define Elephant as U; j = A = 1675; so U = 829 + j = 829 + 1675 = 2504. Define Fox as L; t = U + h = 2504 + 1095 = 3599; p = t + A = 3599 + 1675 = 5274; so L = p + X = 5274 + 335 = 5609. Define Wolf as k; so k = L = 5609. Answer: 5609.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 997 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 952 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Hawk, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Hawk, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Hawk equals 513.
- The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 241 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Crow, the number of Eagle, and the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle as:
Number of Eagle = 997 + Number of Crow + Number of Sparrow
- We can also calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = 952 + Number of Hawk
- And the number of Crow as:
Number of Crow = Number of Parrot + Number of Hawk + Number of Sparrow
- The number of Owl is given by:
Number of Owl = Number of Eagle + Number of Hawk + Number of Crow
- Substituting the values we know, we get:
Number of Owl = (997 + Number of Crow + Number of Sparrow) + 513 + Number of Crow
- Combining like terms, we have:
Number of Owl = 1510 + 2 * Number of Crow
- We can now substitute the expression for Number of Crow from earlier:
Number of Owl = 1510 + 2 * (Number of Parrot + Number of Hawk + Number of Sparrow)
- Finally, we can substitute the value of Number of Hawk:
Number of Owl = 1510 + 2 * (Number of Parrot + 513 + Number of Sparrow)
- Simplifying further, we get:
Number of Owl = 1510 + 2 * (513 + 2 * Number of Sparrow)
- Combining like terms again, we find:
Number of Owl = 1510 + 1026 + 4 * Number of Sparrow
- Therefore, the number of Owl is:
**Answer: 2536 + 4 * Number of Sparrow**<eos>
Define Hawk as a; so a = 513. Define Sparrow as K; w = a = 513; so K = 952 + w = 952 + 513 = 1465. Define Parrot as v; c = K = 1465; so v = 241 + c = 241 + 1465 = 1706. Define Crow as p; n = v + a = 1706 + 513 = 2219; so p = n + K = 2219 + 1465 = 3684. Define Eagle as k; y = p + K = 3684 + 1465 = 5149; so k = 997 + y = 997 + 5149 = 6146. Define Owl as J; h = k + a = 6146 + 513 = 6659; so J = h + p = 6659 + 3684 = 10343. Answer: 10343.

- The number of Blue Jay = Crow + Penguin + Owl + Sparrow = (Peacock + 804) + 18 + Owl + 776 + 18 = Peacock + Owl + 1688.
- The number of Hawk = 361 + Blue Jay = 361 + (Peacock + Owl + 1688) = Peacock + Owl + 2049.

**Answer: Hawk = Peacock + Owl + 2049**<eos>
Define Penguin as d; so d = 18. Define Sparrow as j; P = d = 18; so j = 776 + P = 776 + 18 = 794. Define Owl as g; so g = j = 794. Define Peacock as G; so G = g + j = 794 + 794 = 1588. Define Crow as r; so r = G + j = 1588 + 794 = 2382. Define Blue Jay as Y; c = r + d = 2382 + 18 = 2400; B = c + g = 2400 + 794 = 3194; so Y = B + j = 3194 + 794 = 3988. Define Hawk as f; M = Y = 3988; so f = 361 + M = 361 + 3988 = 4349. Answer: 4349.
**arguments:**

- the number of penguin equals 18.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of peacock and the number of sparrow.
- the number of parrot equals 924 plus the number of penguin.
- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of crow, the number of penguin, the number of owl, and the number of sparrow.
- the number of sparrow equals 776 plus the number of penguin.
- the number of peacock equals the sum of the number of owl and the number of sparrow.
- the number of hawk equals 361 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals the number of sparrow.
- the number of eagle equals 154.

**calculation:**

- the number of crow = peacock + sparrow = peacock + 776 + 18 = peacock + 804.
- the number of blue jay = crow + penguin + owl + sparrow = (peacock + 804) + 18 + owl + 776 + 18 = peacock + owl + 1688.
- the number of hawk = 361 + blue jay = 361 + (peacock + owl + 1688) = peacock + owl + 2049.

- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Bear, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 386 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 820 plus the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf is 859 + 213 = 1072.
- The number of Bear is 386 + 213 = 609.
- The number of Deer is 820 + 1072 = 1892.
- The number of Raccoon is 1892 + 609 + 213 + 1072 = 3666.

**Answer: 3666**<eos>
Define Fox as L; so L = 213. Define Bear as D; N = L = 213; so D = 386 + N = 386 + 213 = 599. Define Wolf as c; Y = D + L = 599 + 213 = 812; so c = 859 + Y = 859 + 812 = 1671. Define Elephant as u; so u = c + D = 1671 + 599 = 2270. Define Deer as I; F = u = 2270; so I = 820 + F = 820 + 2270 = 3090. Define Raccoon as x; t = I + D = 3090 + 599 = 3689; q = t + L = 3689 + 213 = 3902; so x = q + c = 3902 + 1671 = 5573. Answer: 5573.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 20 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 66 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals 936 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Parrot, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 975.
- The number of Crow equals 411 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay = 20 + (Eagle + Parrot) = 20 + (936 + 975) = 20 + 1911 = 1931.
- The number of Owl = 66 + Blue Jay = 66 + 1931 = 2097.
- The number of Sparrow = Owl + Parrot + Eagle = 2097 + 975 + 936 = 3958.
- The number of Crow = 411 + (Sparrow + Blue Jay) = 411 + (3958 + 1931) = 411 + 5889 = 6300.

**Answer: 6300**<eos>
Define Parrot as T; so T = 975. Define Eagle as Y; Q = T = 975; so Y = 936 + Q = 936 + 975 = 1911. Define Blue Jay as K; W = Y + T = 1911 + 975 = 2886; so K = 20 + W = 20 + 2886 = 2906. Define Owl as V; y = K = 2906; so V = 66 + y = 66 + 2906 = 2972. Define Sparrow as l; h = V + T = 2972 + 975 = 3947; so l = h + Y = 3947 + 1911 = 5858. Define Crow as B; L = l + K = 5858 + 2906 = 8764; so B = 411 + L = 411 + 8764 = 9175. Answer: 9175.

Number of Hawk = 250 + Number of Eagle

**Answer:**

**Answer: 1415**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as U; so U = 482. Define Penguin as r; Q = U = 482; so r = 811 + Q = 811 + 482 = 1293. Define Owl as z; so z = r + U = 1293 + 482 = 1775. Define Peacock as K; X = z + r = 1775 + 1293 = 3068; so K = 774 + X = 774 + 3068 = 3842. Define Parrot as w; j = K = 3842; so w = 487 + j = 487 + 3842 = 4329. Define Eagle as E; so E = w + z = 4329 + 1775 = 6104. Define Hawk as s; m = E = 6104; so s = 250 + m = 250 + 6104 = 6354. Answer: 6354.

- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Parrot, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 127 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 437 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow equals 135.
- The number of Eagle equals 957 plus the number of Crow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay = Parrot + Owl + Eagle = P + 127 + E
- The number of Sparrow = Blue Jay + Parrot + Eagle = (P + 127 + E) + P + E = 2P + 254 + E
- The number of Sparrow = 2P + 254 + E = 437 + P + E
- Therefore, P = 183

**Answer: 183**<eos>
Define Crow as E; so E = 135. Define Eagle as V; d = E = 135; so V = 957 + d = 957 + 135 = 1092. Define Owl as W; C = V = 1092; so W = 127 + C = 127 + 1092 = 1219. Define Parrot as g; b = W + V = 1219 + 1092 = 2311; so g = 437 + b = 437 + 2311 = 2748. Define Blue Jay as s; t = g + W = 2748 + 1219 = 3967; so s = t + V = 3967 + 1092 = 5059. Define Sparrow as O; I = s + g = 5059 + 2748 = 7807; so O = I + V = 7807 + 1092 = 8899. Answer: 8899.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of parrot, the number of owl, and the number of eagle.
- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of parrot, and the number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals 127 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of parrot equals 437 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of eagle.
- the number of crow equals 135.
- the number of eagle equals 957 plus the number of crow.

**calculation:**

- the number of blue jay = parrot + owl + eagle = p + 127 + e
- the number of sparrow = blue jay + parrot + eagle = (p + 127 + e) + p + e = 2p + 254 + e
- the number of sparrow = 2p + 254 + e = 437 + p + e
- therefore, p = 183

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 843 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Bear, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 321 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 37 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 951 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 182.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the number of Raccoon:**
Number of Raccoon = 321 + number of Deer
= 321 + 37
= 358

2. **Calculate the number of Elephant:**
Number of Elephant = 843 + number of Raccoon + number of Bear + number of Deer
= 843 + 358 + 182 + 37
= 1320

3. **Calculate the number of Fox:**
Number of Fox = Number of Elephant + number of Bear
= 1320 + 182
= 1502

4. **Calculate the number of Wolf:**
Number of Wolf = 951 + number of Fox
= 951 + 1502
= 2453

**Answer: 2453**<eos>
Define Bear as t; so t = 182. Define Deer as f; Q = t = 182; so f = 37 + Q = 37 + 182 = 219. Define Raccoon as N; x = f = 219; so N = 321 + x = 321 + 219 = 540. Define Elephant as M; G = N + t = 540 + 182 = 722; r = G + f = 722 + 219 = 941; so M = 843 + r = 843 + 941 = 1784. Define Fox as Z; so Z = M + t = 1784 + 182 = 1966. Define Wolf as C; k = Z = 1966; so C = 951 + k = 951 + 1966 = 2917. Answer: 2917.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 231 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 865 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 412 plus the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Crow, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Crow.
- The number of Eagle equals 560 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 382.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Number of Blue Jay = 231 + Number of Sparrow
- We can calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = 865 + Number of Parrot + Number of Eagle
- We can calculate the number of Parrot as:
Number of Parrot = 412 + Number of Owl + Number of Crow + Number of Eagle
- We can calculate the number of Owl as:
Number of Owl = Number of Eagle + Number of Crow
- We can calculate the number of Eagle as:
Number of Eagle = 560 + Number of Crow
- Substituting the above equations into each other, we can solve for the number of Blue Jay:
Number of Blue Jay = 231 + (865 + Number of Parrot + Number of Eagle)
= 231 + (865 + (412 + Number of Owl + Number of Crow + Number of Eagle))
= 231 + (865 + (412 + (560 + Number of Crow)))
= 231 + (865 + (412 + (560 + 382)))
= 231 + (865 + (412 + 560 + 382))
= 231 + (865 + 1354)
= 231 + 2219
**Answer: 2450**<eos>
Define Crow as E; so E = 382. Define Eagle as w; Z = E = 382; so w = 560 + Z = 560 + 382 = 942. Define Owl as B; so B = w + E = 942 + 382 = 1324. Define Parrot as P; V = B + E = 1324 + 382 = 1706; k = V + w = 1706 + 942 = 2648; so P = 412 + k = 412 + 2648 = 3060. Define Sparrow as T; u = P + w = 3060 + 942 = 4002; so T = 865 + u = 865 + 4002 = 4867. Define Blue Jay as i; I = T = 4867; so i = 231 + I = 231 + 4867 = 5098. Answer: 5098.

- The number of Elephant equals 519 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Tiger, and the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger is 904.
- The number of Deer is 914 plus the number of Elephant, which is 519, so the number of Deer is 1433.
- The number of Bear is 520 plus the number of Tiger, which is 904, so the number of Bear is 1424.
- The number of Raccoon is the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Deer, so the number of Raccoon is 904 + 1433 = 2337.
- The number of Fox is 106 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Tiger, so the number of Fox is 106 + 1424 = 1530.
- The number of Wolf is the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Tiger, and the number of Bear, so the number of Wolf is 1433 + 904 + 1424 = 3751.

**Answer: 3751**<eos>
Define Tiger as e; so e = 904. Define Bear as u; x = e = 904; so u = 520 + x = 520 + 904 = 1424. Define Fox as h; g = u + e = 1424 + 904 = 2328; so h = 106 + g = 106 + 2328 = 2434. Define Elephant as L; J = h = 2434; so L = 519 + J = 519 + 2434 = 2953. Define Deer as y; j = L = 2953; so y = 914 + j = 914 + 2953 = 3867. Define Wolf as a; Y = y + e = 3867 + 904 = 4771; so a = Y + u = 4771 + 1424 = 6195. Answer: 6195.

- The number of Blue Jay equals 471 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Owl equals 391.
- The number of Eagle equals 233 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Sparrow equals the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the number of Crow:**
   - The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Blue Jay, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Owl.
   - The number of Crow = 233 + 471 + Sparrow + 391
   - The number of Crow = 1095 + Sparrow

2. **Calculate the number of Parrot:**
   - The number of Parrot equals 356 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Owl.
   - The number of Parrot = 356 + (1095 + Sparrow)
   - The number of Parrot = 1451 + Sparrow

3. **Calculate the number of Sparrow:**
   - The number of Sparrow equals the number of Owl.
   - The number of Sparrow = 391

4. **Calculate the number of Parrot:**
   - The number of Parrot = 1451 + 391
   **Answer: 1842**<eos>
Define Owl as d; so d = 391. Define Sparrow as B; so B = d = 391. Define Blue Jay as F; s = B = 391; so F = 471 + s = 471 + 391 = 862. Define Eagle as t; N = F = 862; so t = 233 + N = 233 + 862 = 1095. Define Crow as E; D = t + F = 1095 + 862 = 1957; O = D + B = 1957 + 391 = 2348; so E = O + d = 2348 + 391 = 2739. Define Parrot as X; M = E + d = 2739 + 391 = 3130; so X = 356 + M = 356 + 3130 = 3486. Answer: 3486.

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated. Problem: The number of Bear equals 993 plus the number of Deer.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 993 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals 705.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Fox equals 650 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals 907 plus the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear equals 993 + number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals the number of Elephant, which is 907.
- Therefore, the number of Bear equals 993 + 907 = 1800.

**Answer: 1800**<eos>
Define Raccoon as V; so V = 705. Define Wolf as K; so K = V = 705. Define Fox as v; b = K + V = 705 + 705 = 1410; so v = 650 + b = 650 + 1410 = 2060. Define Tiger as N; s = v + V = 2060 + 705 = 2765; so N = s + K = 2765 + 705 = 3470. Define Elephant as S; u = N + V = 3470 + 705 = 4175; C = u + K = 4175 + 705 = 4880; so S = 907 + C = 907 + 4880 = 5787. Define Deer as A; so A = S = 5787. Define Bear as w; Q = A = 5787; so w = 993 + Q = 993 + 5787 = 6780. Answer: 6780.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 993 plus the number of deer.
- the number of tiger equals the sum of the number of fox, the number of raccoon, and the number of wolf.
- the number of raccoon equals 705.
- the number of wolf equals the number of raccoon.
- the number of fox equals 650 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of raccoon.
- the number of elephant equals 907 plus the sum of the number of tiger, the number of raccoon, and the number of wolf.
- the number of deer equals the number of elephant.

**calculation:**

- the number of bear equals 993 + number of deer.
- the number of deer equals the number of elephant, which is 907.
- therefore, the number of bear equals 993 + 907 = 1800.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 143 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals 974.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Sparrow, the number of Parrot, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 600 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 392 plus the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the number of Sparrow:**
Number of Sparrow = 143 + (Number of Crow + Number of Blue Jay)
Number of Sparrow = 143 + (600 + 392)
Number of Sparrow = 143 + 992
Number of Sparrow = 1135

2. **Calculate the number of Owl:**
Number of Owl = Number of Sparrow + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Parrot
Number of Owl = 1135 + 392 + 974
Number of Owl = 2491

3. **Calculate the number of Eagle:**
Number of Eagle = Number of Owl + Number of Sparrow + Number of Parrot + Number of Blue Jay
Number of Eagle = 2491 + 1135 + 974 + 392
Number of Eagle = 4992

**Answer: 4992**<eos>
Define Parrot as F; so F = 974. Define Blue Jay as f; G = F = 974; so f = 392 + G = 392 + 974 = 1366. Define Crow as U; t = f = 1366; so U = 600 + t = 600 + 1366 = 1966. Define Sparrow as j; D = U + f = 1966 + 1366 = 3332; so j = 143 + D = 143 + 3332 = 3475. Define Owl as I; l = j + f = 3475 + 1366 = 4841; so I = l + F = 4841 + 974 = 5815. Define Eagle as h; A = I + j = 5815 + 3475 = 9290; o = A + F = 9290 + 974 = 10264; so h = o + f = 10264 + 1366 = 11630. Answer: 11630.
**arguments:**

- the number of sparrow equals 143 plus the sum of the number of crow and the number of blue jay.
- the number of parrot equals 974.
- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of owl, the number of sparrow, the number of parrot, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of sparrow, the number of blue jay, and the number of parrot.
- the number of crow equals 600 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals 392 plus the number of parrot.

**calculation:**

1. **calculate the number of sparrow:**
number of sparrow = 143 + (number of crow + number of blue jay)
number of sparrow = 143 + (600 + 392)
number of sparrow = 143 + 992
number of sparrow = 1135

2. **calculate the number of owl:**
number of owl = number of sparrow + number of blue jay + number of parrot
number of owl = 1135 + 392 + 974
number of owl = 2491

3. **calculate the number of eagle:**
number of eagle = number of owl + number of sparrow + number of parrot + number of blue jay
number of eagle = 2491 + 1135 + 974 + 392
number of eagle = 4992

- The number of Bear equals 282 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Deer, which is 282 + 130 + 27 = 440.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Fox, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Deer, which is 440 + 467 + 130 + 27 = 1064.

**Answer: 1064**<eos>
Define Deer as z; so z = 27. Define Fox as k; K = z = 27; so k = 440 + K = 440 + 27 = 467. Define Raccoon as w; R = k = 467; so w = 130 + R = 130 + 467 = 597. Define Wolf as V; so V = w = 597. Define Bear as y; C = V + w = 597 + 597 = 1194; J = C + z = 1194 + 27 = 1221; so y = 282 + J = 282 + 1221 = 1503. Define Elephant as Q; E = y + k = 1503 + 467 = 1970; L = E + w = 1970 + 597 = 2567; so Q = L + z = 2567 + 27 = 2594. Answer: 2594.

   - Bear = 828 + 144 + 684 + 1116
   - Bear = 3572

**Answer: 3572**<eos>
Define Deer as r; so r = 144. Define Elephant as L; K = r = 144; so L = 684 + K = 684 + 144 = 828. Define Raccoon as c; P = L + r = 828 + 144 = 972; so c = 228 + P = 228 + 972 = 1200. Define Wolf as N; e = c + r = 1200 + 144 = 1344; so N = e + L = 1344 + 828 = 2172. Define Fox as Z; J = N + r = 2172 + 144 = 2316; so Z = J + L = 2316 + 828 = 3144. Define Bear as G; f = Z + r = 3144 + 144 = 3288; U = f + L = 3288 + 828 = 4116; so G = U + c = 4116 + 1200 = 5316. Answer: 5316.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals the sum of the number of wolf, the number of deer, and the number of elephant.
- the number of bear equals the sum of the number of fox, the number of deer, the number of elephant, and the number of raccoon.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 24 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 969 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 429 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Eagle, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Eagle, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals 800.
- The number of Sparrow equals 305 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Number of Blue Jay = 24 + Sparrow + Eagle
- We can also calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = 305 + Eagle
- Substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of Blue Jay, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 24 + (305 + Eagle) + Eagle
- Simplifying this equation, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 329 + 2Eagle
- From the given information, we know that the number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Eagle, and the number of Blue Jay.
- Therefore, we can calculate the number of Owl as:
Number of Owl = Parrot + Eagle + Blue Jay
- Substituting the values we have calculated, we get:
Number of Owl = 969 + 800 + (329 + 2Eagle)
- Simplifying this equation, we get:
Number of Owl = 1798 + 2Eagle

**Answer: Answer: 1798 + 2Eagle**<eos>
Define Eagle as s; so s = 800. Define Sparrow as v; R = s = 800; so v = 305 + R = 305 + 800 = 1105. Define Blue Jay as j; x = v + s = 1105 + 800 = 1905; so j = 24 + x = 24 + 1905 = 1929. Define Crow as E; k = j + s = 1929 + 800 = 2729; J = k + v = 2729 + 1105 = 3834; so E = 429 + J = 429 + 3834 = 4263. Define Parrot as A; d = E = 4263; so A = 969 + d = 969 + 4263 = 5232. Define Owl as Y; u = A + s = 5232 + 800 = 6032; so Y = u + j = 6032 + 1929 = 7961. Answer: 7961.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay equals 24 plus the sum of the number of sparrow and the number of eagle.
- the number of parrot equals 969 plus the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals 429 plus the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of eagle, and the number of sparrow.
- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of parrot, the number of eagle, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of eagle equals 800.
- the number of sparrow equals 305 plus the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of blue jay as:
number of blue jay = 24 + sparrow + eagle
- we can also calculate the number of sparrow as:
number of sparrow = 305 + eagle
- substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of blue jay, we get:
number of blue jay = 24 + (305 + eagle) + eagle
- simplifying this equation, we get:
number of blue jay = 329 + 2eagle
- from the given information, we know that the number of owl equals the sum of the number of parrot, the number of eagle, and the number of blue jay.
- therefore, we can calculate the number of owl as:
number of owl = parrot + eagle + blue jay
- substituting the values we have calculated, we get:
number of owl = 969 + 800 + (329 + 2eagle)
- simplifying this equation, we get:
number of owl = 1798 + 2eagle

**answer: answer: 1798 + 2eagle**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 252 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 847 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals 490.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 842 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Owl, the number of Crow, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Sparrow equals 807 plus the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Crow = 252 + (Sparrow + Owl) = 252 + (807 + Owl) = 252 + 807 + Owl = 1059 + Owl.
- The number of Eagle = 847 + (1059 + Owl) = 847 + 1059 + Owl = 1906 + Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay = 842 + (1906 + Owl + Sparrow) = 842 + 1906 + Owl + 807 = 2555 + Owl.
- The number of Parrot = 2555 + Owl + 490 + 1059 + 1906 = 5350 + Owl.

**Answer: Parrot = 5350 + Owl**<eos>
Define Owl as C; so C = 490. Define Sparrow as P; o = C = 490; so P = 807 + o = 807 + 490 = 1297. Define Crow as D; c = P + C = 1297 + 490 = 1787; so D = 252 + c = 252 + 1787 = 2039. Define Eagle as Q; U = D = 2039; so Q = 847 + U = 847 + 2039 = 2886. Define Blue Jay as h; W = Q + P = 2886 + 1297 = 4183; so h = 842 + W = 842 + 4183 = 5025. Define Parrot as T; n = h + C = 5025 + 490 = 5515; X = n + D = 5515 + 2039 = 7554; so T = X + Q = 7554 + 2886 = 10440. Answer: 10440.

    - The number of Crow = 922 + Sparrow
    - The number of Blue Jay = Eagle + Crow
    - The number of Parrot = Owl + Crow

- Substituting the values we get:
    - The number of Parrot = (457 + Hawk + Blue Jay) + (922 + Sparrow)
    - The number of Parrot = (457 + 971 + Blue Jay) + (922 + 597)
    - The number of Parrot = 1428 + Blue Jay + 1519
    - The number of Parrot = 2947 + Blue Jay

**Answer: 2947 + Blue Jay**<eos>
Define Sparrow as C; so C = 597. Define Crow as q; W = C = 597; so q = 922 + W = 922 + 597 = 1519. Define Eagle as r; so r = q + C = 1519 + 597 = 2116. Define Blue Jay as w; so w = r + q = 2116 + 1519 = 3635. Define Peacock as t; s = w + q = 3635 + 1519 = 5154; so t = 971 + s = 971 + 5154 = 6125. Define Penguin as O; so O = t = 6125. Define Hawk as e; so e = O = 6125. Define Owl as o; A = e + w = 6125 + 3635 = 9760; so o = 457 + A = 457 + 9760 = 10217. Define Parrot as U; so U = o + q = 10217 + 1519 = 11736. Answer: 11736.

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Wolf, the number of Fox, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals 971.
- The number of Fox equals 783 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Raccoon equals 239 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 393 plus the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear = Raccoon + Wolf + Fox + Elephant = 239 + 393 + 783 + 971 = 2476.
- The number of Deer = Bear + Elephant + Fox = 2476 + 971 + 783 = 4230.

**Answer: 4230**<eos>
Define Elephant as x; so x = 971. Define Wolf as y; q = x = 971; so y = 393 + q = 393 + 971 = 1364. Define Fox as H; J = y + x = 1364 + 971 = 2335; so H = 783 + J = 783 + 2335 = 3118. Define Raccoon as o; l = H = 3118; so o = 239 + l = 239 + 3118 = 3357. Define Bear as r; h = o + y = 3357 + 1364 = 4721; j = h + H = 4721 + 3118 = 7839; so r = j + x = 7839 + 971 = 8810. Define Deer as v; W = r + x = 8810 + 971 = 9781; so v = W + H = 9781 + 3118 = 12899. Answer: 12899.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 687 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 587 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Elephant, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 164.
- The number of Deer equals 964 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 598 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Raccoon equals 283 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox is 598 plus the number of Bear, which is 598 + 164 = 762.
- The number of Elephant is 687 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Fox, which is 687 + (283 + 762) = 1732.
- The number of Deer is 964 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Fox, which is 964 + 1732 + 762 = 3458.
- The number of Wolf is 587 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Elephant, and the number of Fox, which is 587 + 3458 + 762 = 5007.

**Answer: 5007**<eos>
Define Bear as O; so O = 164. Define Fox as l; P = O = 164; so l = 598 + P = 598 + 164 = 762. Define Raccoon as c; j = l + O = 762 + 164 = 926; so c = 283 + j = 283 + 926 = 1209. Define Elephant as h; C = c + l = 1209 + 762 = 1971; so h = 687 + C = 687 + 1971 = 2658. Define Deer as q; R = h + l = 2658 + 762 = 3420; so q = 964 + R = 964 + 3420 = 4384. Define Wolf as X; I = q + h = 4384 + 2658 = 7042; H = I + l = 7042 + 762 = 7804; so X = 587 + H = 587 + 7804 = 8391. Answer: 8391.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals 614 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 730 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Fox equals 759 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 164.
- The number of Wolf equals 27 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 973 plus the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon is 614 + 164 = 778.
- The number of Wolf is 27 + 778 = 805.
- The number of Elephant is 730 + 805 = 1535.
- The number of Bear is 973 + 1535 + 164 = 2672.
- The number of Fox is 759 + 2672 = 3431.

**Answer: 3431**<eos>
Define Deer as G; so G = 164. Define Raccoon as u; h = G = 164; so u = 614 + h = 614 + 164 = 778. Define Wolf as i; E = u + G = 778 + 164 = 942; so i = 27 + E = 27 + 942 = 969. Define Elephant as j; m = i + u = 969 + 778 = 1747; so j = 730 + m = 730 + 1747 = 2477. Define Bear as V; H = j + i = 2477 + 969 = 3446; I = H + G = 3446 + 164 = 3610; so V = 973 + I = 973 + 3610 = 4583. Define Fox as Z; M = V = 4583; so Z = 759 + M = 759 + 4583 = 5342. Answer: 5342.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals 572 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon equals 67 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Tiger, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 941 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Bear equals the number of Elephant.
- The number of Wolf equals 709 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 932.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Tiger as:
Number of Tiger = 572 + (Number of Wolf + Number of Fox)
- The number of Raccoon is given as:
Number of Raccoon = 67 + (Number of Bear + Number of Deer)
- The number of Deer is given as:
Number of Deer = 941 + Number of Tiger
- The number of Elephant is equal to the number of Bear, which is the same as the number of Tiger.
- The number of Fox is given as:
Number of Fox = 932
- We can substitute the above equations into each other to solve for the number of Raccoon:
Number of Raccoon = 67 + (Number of Bear + 941 + Number of Tiger - Number of Tiger)
= 67 + Number of Bear
- Since the number of Bear is equal to the number of Elephant, which is equal to the number of Tiger, we can substitute the number of Tiger for the number of Bear:
Number of Raccoon = 67 + 572 + 709 + 932 - 572
= 1670

**Answer: 1670**<eos>
Define Fox as W; so W = 932. Define Wolf as C; v = W = 932; so C = 709 + v = 709 + 932 = 1641. Define Tiger as D; O = C + W = 1641 + 932 = 2573; so D = 572 + O = 572 + 2573 = 3145. Define Deer as I; p = D = 3145; so I = 941 + p = 941 + 3145 = 4086. Define Elephant as d; J = I + D = 4086 + 3145 = 7231; so d = J + W = 7231 + 932 = 8163. Define Bear as B; so B = d = 8163. Define Raccoon as F; X = B + I = 8163 + 4086 = 12249; so F = 67 + X = 67 + 12249 = 12316. Answer: 12316.
**arguments:**

- the number of tiger equals 572 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of fox.

Number of Eagle = 369 + 2 * Number of Sparrow

- We can calculate the number of Crow as follows:
Number of Crow = Number of Hawk = 666

- The number of Parrot is given by:
Number of Parrot = 985 + Number of Crow + Number of Hawk

- The number of Blue Jay is given by:
Number of Blue Jay = Number of Parrot + Number of Hawk + Number of Crow

**Answer:**

**Answer: 369 + 2 * Number of Sparrow**<eos>
Define Hawk as e; so e = 666. Define Crow as a; so a = e = 666. Define Parrot as g; S = a + e = 666 + 666 = 1332; so g = 985 + S = 985 + 1332 = 2317. Define Blue Jay as p; u = g + e = 2317 + 666 = 2983; so p = u + a = 2983 + 666 = 3649. Define Penguin as H; so H = p + g = 3649 + 2317 = 5966. Define Sparrow as Q; so Q = H = 5966. Define Owl as J; r = Q = 5966; so J = 352 + r = 352 + 5966 = 6318. Define Eagle as s; B = J + Q = 6318 + 5966 = 12284; so s = 7 + B = 7 + 12284 = 12291. Answer: 12291.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 87 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Owl equals 857 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Crow.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Crow, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 364.
- The number of Crow equals 823 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Hawk equals 593 plus the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl as follows:
Number of Owl = 857 + (Number of Blue Jay + Number of Crow)
- We can also calculate the number of Sparrow as follows:
Number of Sparrow = Number of Owl + Number of Crow + Number of Parrot
- Substituting the values of Number of Parrot and Number of Crow, we get:
Number of Sparrow = 857 + Number of Blue Jay + 823 + 364
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
Number of Sparrow = 1644 + Number of Blue Jay
- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle as follows:
Number of Eagle = 87 + Number of Sparrow + Number of Owl
- Substituting the values of Number of Sparrow and Number of Owl, we get:
Number of Eagle = 87 + (1644 + Number of Blue Jay) + 857
- Simplifying the equation, we get:
Number of Eagle = 2568 + Number of Blue Jay

**Answer: Answer: 2568 + Number of Blue Jay**<eos>
Define Parrot as I; so I = 364. Define Hawk as S; g = I = 364; so S = 593 + g = 593 + 364 = 957. Define Crow as G; J = S = 957; so G = 823 + J = 823 + 957 = 1780. Define Blue Jay as n; so n = G + S = 1780 + 957 = 2737. Define Owl as a; b = n + G = 2737 + 1780 = 4517; so a = 857 + b = 857 + 4517 = 5374. Define Sparrow as f; x = a + G = 5374 + 1780 = 7154; so f = x + I = 7154 + 364 = 7518. Define Eagle as A; B = f + a = 7518 + 5374 = 12892; so A = 87 + B = 87 + 12892 = 12979. Answer: 12979.

- The number of Raccoon equals 802 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Lion equals 304.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Horse, the number of Wolf, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Horse equals 588 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 723.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Bear equals the number of Elephant, and the number of Elephant equals the number of Tiger. Therefore, the number of Bear equals the number of Tiger.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Horse, the number of Wolf, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 802 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Horse equals 588 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Bear.

Substituting the given values into the equations, we get:

Number of Tiger = Number of Horse + Number of Wolf + Number of Raccoon + Number of Deer
Number of Raccoon = 802 + Number of Wolf
Number of Horse = 588 + Number of Deer + Number of Raccoon
Number of Deer = Number of Raccoon
Number of Fox = Number of Bear

Solving these equations, we get:

Number of Tiger = 304 + 723 + 802 + Number of Deer = 1829 + Number of Deer
Number of Raccoon = 802 + Number of Wolf
Number of Horse = 588 + Number of Deer + 802 + Number of Wolf = 1390 + Number of Deer + Number of Wolf
Number of Deer = Number of Raccoon = 802 + Number of Wolf
Number of Fox = Number of Bear = 1829 + Number of Deer

Therefore, the number of Fox is 1829 + Number of Deer.<eos>
Define Wolf as P; so P = 723. Define Raccoon as T; U = P = 723; so T = 802 + U = 802 + 723 = 1525. Define Deer as L; so L = T = 1525. Define Horse as f; s = L + T = 1525 + 1525 = 3050; so f = 588 + s = 588 + 3050 = 3638. Define Tiger as r; t = f + P = 3638 + 723 = 4361; p = t + T = 4361 + 1525 = 5886; so r = p + L = 5886 + 1525 = 7411. Define Elephant as W; so W = r = 7411. Define Bear as Q; so Q = W = 7411. Define Fox as J; so J = Q = 7411. Answer: 7411.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals the number of elephant.
- the number of elephant equals the number of tiger.
- the number of raccoon equals 802 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of lion equals 304.
- the number of tiger equals the sum of the number of horse, the number of wolf, the number of raccoon, and the number of deer.
- the number of horse equals 588 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of raccoon.
- the number of deer equals the number of raccoon.
- the number of fox equals the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals 723.

**calculation:**

- the number of horse equals 588 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of raccoon.
- the number of deer equals the number of raccoon.
- the number of fox equals the number of bear.

substituting the given values into the equations, we get:

number of tiger = number of horse + number of wolf + number of raccoon + number of deer
number of raccoon = 802 + number of wolf
number of horse = 588 + number of deer + number of raccoon
number of deer = number of raccoon
number of fox = number of bear

solving these equations, we get:

number of tiger = 304 + 723 + 802 + number of deer = 1829 + number of deer
number of raccoon = 802 + number of wolf
number of horse = 588 + number of deer + 802 + number of wolf = 1390 + number of deer + number of wolf
number of deer = number of raccoon = 802 + number of wolf
number of fox = number of bear = 1829 + number of deer

therefore, the number of fox is 1829 + number of deer.<eos>

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question!

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 703 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals 325.
- The number of Wolf equals 712 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Elephant, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 329 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 326 plus the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox = 703 + (326 + 325) = 703 + 651 = 1354.
- The number of Wolf = 712 + 1354 + 326 = 2392.
- The number of Raccoon = 2392 + 1354 = 3746.
- The number of Bear = 329 + 3746 + 2392 = 6537.

**Answer: 6537**<eos>
Define Elephant as b; so b = 325. Define Deer as p; A = b = 325; so p = 326 + A = 326 + 325 = 651. Define Fox as z; N = p + b = 651 + 325 = 976; so z = 703 + N = 703 + 976 = 1679. Define Wolf as g; V = z + b = 1679 + 325 = 2004; I = V + p = 2004 + 651 = 2655; so g = 712 + I = 712 + 2655 = 3367. Define Raccoon as x; so x = g + z = 3367 + 1679 = 5046. Define Bear as C; L = x + z = 5046 + 1679 = 6725; R = L + g = 6725 + 3367 = 10092; so C = 329 + R = 329 + 10092 = 10421. Answer: 10421.

- The number of Bear equals 927 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Bear, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf = 30 + Raccoon + Elephant = 30 + 903 + 928 = 1831.
- The number of Raccoon = 903 + Bear + Elephant = 903 + (927 + Elephant) = 903 + 927 + 928 = 2758.
- The number of Fox = Wolf + Bear + Raccoon + Elephant = 1831 + 927 + 2758 + 928 = 6462.
- The number of Deer = Fox + Wolf + Elephant = 6462 + 1831 + 928 = 9221.

**Answer: 9221**<eos>
Define Elephant as l; so l = 928. Define Bear as z; s = l = 928; so z = 927 + s = 927 + 928 = 1855. Define Raccoon as q; W = z + l = 1855 + 928 = 2783; so q = 903 + W = 903 + 2783 = 3686. Define Wolf as H; h = q + l = 3686 + 928 = 4614; so H = 30 + h = 30 + 4614 = 4644. Define Fox as u; e = H + z = 4644 + 1855 = 6499; C = e + q = 6499 + 3686 = 10185; so u = C + l = 10185 + 928 = 11113. Define Deer as w; o = u + H = 11113 + 4644 = 15757; so w = o + l = 15757 + 928 = 16685. Answer: 16685.

- The number of Owl = number of Sparrow = unknown.

**Answer:**

**Answer: The number of Owl is unknown.**<eos>
Define Parrot as x; so x = 889. Define Penguin as Y; S = x = 889; so Y = 115 + S = 115 + 889 = 1004. Define Blue Jay as V; W = Y + x = 1004 + 889 = 1893; so V = 990 + W = 990 + 1893 = 2883. Define Hawk as D; so D = V = 2883. Define Eagle as m; h = D = 2883; so m = 297 + h = 297 + 2883 = 3180. Define Crow as j; so j = m + Y = 3180 + 1004 = 4184. Define Peacock as P; so P = j + x = 4184 + 889 = 5073. Define Sparrow as F; so F = P + x = 5073 + 889 = 5962. Define Owl as N; so N = F = 5962. Answer: 5962.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 341 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 517.
- The number of Sparrow equals 441 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 733 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Eagle, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 464 plus the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Parrot as:
Parrot = 341 + (Crow + Sparrow + Blue Jay)
- We can also calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Blue Jay = Sparrow + Eagle + Owl
- Substituting the above equation for Blue Jay into the equation for Parrot, we get:
Parrot = 341 + (Crow + Sparrow + (Sparrow + Eagle + Owl))
- Simplifying this equation, we get:
Parrot = 341 + 2 * Sparrow + Eagle + Owl
- We are given that the number of Owl equals 517, so we can substitute this value into the above equation:
Parrot = 341 + 2 * Sparrow + 517
- We can also calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Sparrow = 441 + Eagle
- Substituting this value for Sparrow into the equation for Parrot, we get:
Parrot = 341 + 2 * (441 + Eagle) + 517
- Simplifying this equation, we get:
Parrot = 341 + 882 + 2 * Eagle + 517
- Combining like terms, we get:
Parrot = 1730 + 2 * Eagle
- We are not given the value of Eagle, so we cannot calculate the exact number of Parrot.

**Answer: 1730 + 2 * Eagle**<eos>
Define Owl as t; so t = 517. Define Eagle as Q; q = t = 517; so Q = 464 + q = 464 + 517 = 981. Define Sparrow as e; H = Q + t = 981 + 517 = 1498; so e = 441 + H = 441 + 1498 = 1939. Define Blue Jay as m; d = e + Q = 1939 + 981 = 2920; so m = d + t = 2920 + 517 = 3437. Define Crow as v; r = m = 3437; so v = 733 + r = 733 + 3437 = 4170. Define Parrot as F; i = v + e = 4170 + 1939 = 6109; h = i + m = 6109 + 3437 = 9546; so F = 341 + h = 341 + 9546 = 9887. Answer: 9887.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 341 plus the sum of the number of crow, the number of sparrow, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals 517.
- the number of sparrow equals 441 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of owl.
- the number of crow equals 733 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of sparrow, the number of eagle, and the number of owl.
- the number of eagle equals 464 plus the number of owl.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of parrot as:
parrot = 341 + (crow + sparrow + blue jay)
- we can also calculate the number of blue jay as:
blue jay = sparrow + eagle + owl
- substituting the above equation for blue jay into the equation for parrot, we get:
parrot = 341 + (crow + sparrow + (sparrow + eagle + owl))
- simplifying this equation, we get:
parrot = 341 + 2 * sparrow + eagle + owl
- we are given that the number of owl equals 517, so we can substitute this value into the above equation:
parrot = 341 + 2 * sparrow + 517
- we can also calculate the number of sparrow as:
sparrow = 441 + eagle
- substituting this value for sparrow into the equation for parrot, we get:
parrot = 341 + 2 * (441 + eagle) + 517
- simplifying this equation, we get:
parrot = 341 + 882 + 2 * eagle + 517
- combining like terms, we get:
parrot = 1730 + 2 * eagle
- we are not given the value of eagle, so we cannot calculate the exact number of parrot.

**Answer: 4580**<eos>
Define Crow as b; so b = 552. Define Blue Jay as A; t = b = 552; so A = 935 + t = 935 + 552 = 1487. Define Hawk as Z; s = A + b = 1487 + 552 = 2039; so Z = 315 + s = 315 + 2039 = 2354. Define Parrot as Y; M = Z + b = 2354 + 552 = 2906; I = M + A = 2906 + 1487 = 4393; so Y = 123 + I = 123 + 4393 = 4516. Define Eagle as E; q = Y = 4516; so E = 639 + q = 639 + 4516 = 5155. Define Owl as p; so p = E + A = 5155 + 1487 = 6642. Define Sparrow as X; so X = p + Z = 6642 + 2354 = 8996. Answer: 8996.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 639 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of eagle and the number of blue jay.
- the number of crow equals 552.
- the number of hawk equals 315 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of crow.
- the number of blue jay equals 935 plus the number of crow.
- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of owl and the number of hawk.
- the number of parrot equals 123 plus the sum of the number of hawk, the number of crow, and the number of blue jay.

**calculation:**

- the number of parrot is 639 + 123 = 762.
- the number of blue jay is 935 + 552 = 1487.
- the number of owl is 639 + 1487 = 2126.
- the number of hawk is 315 + 1487 + 552 = 2454.

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 553 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Lion equals 755.
- The number of Fox equals 791 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 470 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Tiger equals 82 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Lion.
- The number of Bear equals 44 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals 206 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Lion.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Wolf equals the number of Deer, so let's assume both are x.
- The number of Elephant equals 553 plus the number of Raccoon, so we have:
Number of Elephant = 553 + y
- The number of Lion equals 755, so we have:
Number of Lion = 755
- The number of Fox equals 791 plus the number of Deer, so we have:
Number of Fox = 791 + x
- The number of Raccoon equals 470 plus the number of Lion, so we have:
Number of Raccoon = 470 + 755 = 1225
- The number of Tiger equals 82 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Lion, so we have:
Number of Tiger = 82 + (553 + y) = 635 + y
- The number of Bear equals 44 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Raccoon, so we have:
Number of Bear = 44 + (x + 1225) = 1269 + x
- The number of Deer equals 206 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Lion, so we have:
Number of Deer = 206 + (635 + y) = 841 + y

**Answer:**

Number of Bear = 1269 + x<eos>
Define Lion as O; so O = 755. Define Raccoon as h; H = O = 755; so h = 470 + H = 470 + 755 = 1225. Define Elephant as Q; e = h = 1225; so Q = 553 + e = 553 + 1225 = 1778. Define Tiger as p; J = Q + O = 1778 + 755 = 2533; so p = 82 + J = 82 + 2533 = 2615. Define Deer as n; X = p + O = 2615 + 755 = 3370; so n = 206 + X = 206 + 3370 = 3576. Define Wolf as o; so o = n = 3576. Define Bear as N; u = o + h = 3576 + 1225 = 4801; so N = 44 + u = 44 + 4801 = 4845. Answer: 4845.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Hawk.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 582 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 563.
- The number of Hawk equals 142 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 733 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Crow, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot equals 733 + (the number of Eagle) + (the number of Crow) + (the number of Blue Jay).
- The number of Sparrow equals the number of Owl + the number of Blue Jay + the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Hawk, which equals 142 + the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 582 + the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 563.
- The number of Eagle equals the number of Blue Jay.

Substituting the above equations into each other, we get:

The number of Sparrow = (142 + 733 + 563) + (582 + 563) + the number of Eagle
= 1338 + 1145 + the number of Eagle
= 2483 + the number of Eagle

Therefore, the number of Sparrow is 2483 + the number of Eagle.<eos>
Define Crow as e; so e = 563. Define Blue Jay as m; M = e = 563; so m = 582 + M = 582 + 563 = 1145. Define Eagle as l; so l = m = 1145. Define Parrot as C; Z = l + e = 1145 + 563 = 1708; R = Z + m = 1708 + 1145 = 2853; so C = 733 + R = 733 + 2853 = 3586. Define Hawk as u; Y = C = 3586; so u = 142 + Y = 142 + 3586 = 3728. Define Owl as v; so v = u = 3728. Define Sparrow as D; J = v + m = 3728 + 1145 = 4873; so D = J + l = 4873 + 1145 = 6018. Answer: 6018.
**arguments:**

- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of owl, the number of blue jay, and the number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals the number of hawk.
- the number of blue jay equals 582 plus the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals 563.
- the number of hawk equals 142 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 733 plus the sum of the number of eagle, the number of crow, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of eagle equals the number of blue jay.

**calculation:**

- the number of parrot equals 733 + (the number of eagle) + (the number of crow) + (the number of blue jay).
- the number of sparrow equals the number of owl + the number of blue jay + the number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals the number of hawk, which equals 142 + the number of parrot.
- the number of blue jay equals 582 + the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals 563.
- the number of eagle equals the number of blue jay.

substituting the above equations into each other, we get:

the number of sparrow = (142 + 733 + 563) + (582 + 563) + the number of eagle
= 1338 + 1145 + the number of eagle
= 2483 + the number of eagle

therefore, the number of sparrow is 2483 + the number of eagle.<eos>

- The number of Elephant = 457 + Tiger + Bear = 457 + z + z = 457 + 2z
- The number of Wolf = Deer + Tiger = (529 + y) + z

**Answer:**

**Answer: 499 + x + y + z**<eos>
Define Bear as B; so B = 892. Define Tiger as w; x = B = 892; so w = 127 + x = 127 + 892 = 1019. Define Elephant as f; o = w + B = 1019 + 892 = 1911; so f = 457 + o = 457 + 1911 = 2368. Define Deer as Y; m = f = 2368; so Y = 529 + m = 529 + 2368 = 2897. Define Wolf as F; so F = Y + w = 2897 + 1019 = 3916. Define Raccoon as e; K = F + f = 3916 + 2368 = 6284; T = K + w = 6284 + 1019 = 7303; so e = 499 + T = 499 + 7303 = 7802. Define Fox as L; so L = e = 7802. Answer: 7802.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 626 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Eagle, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals 417 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 914 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 177.
- The number of Parrot equals 944 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 455 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Sparrow = 626 + (Blue Jay + Eagle + Crow)
- The number of Owl = 417 + (Sparrow + Crow)
- The number of Blue Jay = 914 + (Crow + Eagle)
- The number of Parrot = 944 + Owl

- Substituting the value of Eagle (177) into the equation for Blue Jay:
The number of Blue Jay = 914 + (Crow + 177)
- Substituting the value of Crow (455) into the equation for Sparrow:
The number of Sparrow = 626 + (914 + (455 + 177))
- Simplifying the equation for Sparrow:
The number of Sparrow = 626 + 1546
- The number of Sparrow = 2172

- Substituting the value of Sparrow (2172) into the equation for Owl:
The number of Owl = 417 + (2172 + 455)
- Simplifying the equation for Owl:
The number of Owl = 417 + 2627
- The number of Owl = 3044

- Substituting the value of Owl (3044) into the equation for Parrot:
The number of Parrot = 944 + 3044
- The number of Parrot = 4088

**Answer: 4088**<eos>
Define Eagle as W; so W = 177. Define Crow as f; e = W = 177; so f = 455 + e = 455 + 177 = 632. Define Blue Jay as Y; P = f + W = 632 + 177 = 809; so Y = 914 + P = 914 + 809 = 1723. Define Sparrow as A; q = Y + W = 1723 + 177 = 1900; t = q + f = 1900 + 632 = 2532; so A = 626 + t = 626 + 2532 = 3158. Define Owl as r; z = A + f = 3158 + 632 = 3790; so r = 417 + z = 417 + 3790 = 4207. Define Parrot as p; Q = r = 4207; so p = 944 + Q = 944 + 4207 = 5151. Answer: 5151.

- the number of owl = 417 + (sparrow + crow)
- the number of blue jay = 914 + (crow + eagle)
- the number of parrot = 944 + owl

- substituting the value of eagle (177) into the equation for blue jay:
the number of blue jay = 914 + (crow + 177)
- substituting the value of crow (455) into the equation for sparrow:
the number of sparrow = 626 + (914 + (455 + 177))
- simplifying the equation for sparrow:
the number of sparrow = 626 + 1546
- the number of sparrow = 2172

- substituting the value of sparrow (2172) into the equation for owl:
the number of owl = 417 + (2172 + 455)
- simplifying the equation for owl:
the number of owl = 417 + 2627
- the number of owl = 3044

- substituting the value of owl (3044) into the equation for parrot:
the number of parrot = 944 + 3044
- the number of parrot = 4088

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 772 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Sparrow, the number of Crow, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow equals 539.
- The number of Eagle equals 65 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 705 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals 641 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Sparrow is 772 + 539 = 1311.
- The number of Blue Jay is 705 + 1311 + 539 + 65 = 2164.
- The number of Owl is 641 + 2164 = 2805.

**Answer: 2805**<eos>
Define Crow as s; so s = 539. Define Sparrow as i; g = s = 539; so i = 772 + g = 772 + 539 = 1311. Define Eagle as f; D = i + s = 1311 + 539 = 1850; so f = 65 + D = 65 + 1850 = 1915. Define Parrot as R; d = f + s = 1915 + 539 = 2454; so R = 705 + d = 705 + 2454 = 3159. Define Blue Jay as H; L = R + i = 3159 + 1311 = 4470; A = L + s = 4470 + 539 = 5009; so H = A + f = 5009 + 1915 = 6924. Define Owl as I; K = H + f = 6924 + 1915 = 8839; so I = 641 + K = 641 + 8839 = 9480. Answer: 9480.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals 301.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Fox, the number of Tiger, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Tiger.
- The number of Bear equals 276 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals 929 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Tiger, and the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf = 301 + Deer + Fox + Elephant
- The number of Deer = Elephant + Tiger
- The number of Fox = Tiger
- The number of Bear = 276 + Raccoon
- The number of Elephant = 929 + Fox + Tiger
- The number of Raccoon = Wolf + Tiger + Elephant

Substituting the values of Tiger, Deer, and Elephant into the above equations, we get:

- The number of Wolf = 301 + (Elephant + Tiger) + Tiger + Elephant = 301 + 2 * Tiger + Elephant
- The number of Deer = Elephant + Tiger
- The number of Fox = Tiger
- The number of Bear = 276 + (Wolf + Tiger + Elephant)
- The number of Elephant = 929 + Fox + Tiger
- The number of Raccoon = (301 + 2 * Tiger + Elephant) + Tiger + Elephant

Simplifying, we get:

- The number of Wolf = 301 + 3 * Tiger + Elephant
- The number of Deer = Elephant + Tiger
- The number of Fox = Tiger
- The number of Bear = 276 + 3 * Tiger + Elephant
- The number of Elephant = 929 + 2 * Tiger
- The number of Raccoon = 3 * Tiger + 2 * Elephant

**Answer: Answer: 276 + 3 * Tiger + Elephant**<eos>
Define Tiger as x; so x = 301. Define Fox as z; so z = x = 301. Define Elephant as q; B = z + x = 301 + 301 = 602; so q = 929 + B = 929 + 602 = 1531. Define Deer as Y; so Y = q + x = 1531 + 301 = 1832. Define Wolf as i; w = Y + z = 1832 + 301 = 2133; W = w + x = 2133 + 301 = 2434; so i = W + q = 2434 + 1531 = 3965. Define Raccoon as X; n = i + x = 3965 + 301 = 4266; so X = n + q = 4266 + 1531 = 5797. Define Bear as M; l = X = 5797; so M = 276 + l = 276 + 5797 = 6073. Answer: 6073.
**arguments:**

- the number of tiger equals 301.
- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of deer, the number of fox, the number of tiger, and the number of elephant.
- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of elephant and the number of tiger.
- the number of fox equals the number of tiger.
- the number of bear equals 276 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of elephant equals 929 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of tiger.
- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of wolf, the number of tiger, and the number of elephant.

**calculation:**

- the number of wolf = 301 + deer + fox + elephant
- the number of deer = elephant + tiger
- the number of fox = tiger
- the number of bear = 276 + raccoon
- the number of elephant = 929 + fox + tiger
- the number of raccoon = wolf + tiger + elephant

substituting the values of tiger, deer, and elephant into the above equations, we get:

- the number of wolf = 301 + (elephant + tiger) + tiger + elephant = 301 + 2 * tiger + elephant
- the number of deer = elephant + tiger
- the number of fox = tiger
- the number of bear = 276 + (wolf + tiger + elephant)
- the number of elephant = 929 + fox + tiger
- the number of raccoon = (301 + 2 * tiger + elephant) + tiger + elephant

simplifying, we get:

- the number of wolf = 301 + 3 * tiger + elephant
- the number of deer = elephant + tiger
- the number of fox = tiger
- the number of bear = 276 + 3 * tiger + elephant
- the number of elephant = 929 + 2 * tiger
- the number of raccoon = 3 * tiger + 2 * elephant

- The number of Deer = 965 + Wolf + Tiger + Raccoon = 965 + (number of Elephant) + 1254 + Bear + 688 = 2807 + Bear + (number of Elephant).

**Answer: Answer: 2807 + Bear + (number of Elephant)**<eos>
Define Raccoon as Y; so Y = 688. Define Fox as p; M = Y = 688; so p = 38 + M = 38 + 688 = 726. Define Bear as c; so c = p = 726. Define Tiger as e; v = c + Y = 726 + 688 = 1414; n = v + p = 1414 + 726 = 2140; so e = 528 + n = 528 + 2140 = 2668. Define Elephant as k; so k = e + p = 2668 + 726 = 3394. Define Wolf as w; so w = k = 3394. Define Deer as N; g = w + e = 3394 + 2668 = 6062; E = g + Y = 6062 + 688 = 6750; so N = 965 + E = 965 + 6750 = 7715. Answer: 7715.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 20 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 442 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 726 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Fox.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Deer, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 625.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Elephant.
- The number of Raccoon equals 955 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Elephant = 20 + 625 = 645.
- The number of Fox = 645.
- The number of Deer = 442 + (625 + Fox) = 442 + (625 + 645) = 1612.
- The number of Tiger = Raccoon + Deer + Wolf = 955 + 1612 + 625 = 3192.
- The number of Bear = 726 + (Tiger + Fox) = 726 + (3192 + 645) = 4523.

**Answer: 4523**<eos>
Define Wolf as m; so m = 625. Define Elephant as S; y = m = 625; so S = 20 + y = 20 + 625 = 645. Define Fox as z; so z = S = 645. Define Deer as q; c = z + m = 645 + 625 = 1270; so q = 442 + c = 442 + 1270 = 1712. Define Raccoon as x; N = q + m = 1712 + 625 = 2337; so x = 955 + N = 955 + 2337 = 3292. Define Tiger as o; H = x + q = 3292 + 1712 = 5004; so o = H + m = 5004 + 625 = 5629. Define Bear as Q; D = o + z = 5629 + 645 = 6274; so Q = 726 + D = 726 + 6274 = 7000. Answer: 7000.

Bear = 718 + Wolf

2. **Calculate the number of Wolf:**
Wolf = Deer + Bear
Wolf = 386 + Bear

3. **Calculate the number of Raccoon:**
Raccoon = 718 + Wolf
Raccoon = 718 + (386 + Bear)
Raccoon = 1004 + Bear

4. **Calculate the number of Tiger:**
Tiger = Fox + Raccoon + Deer
Tiger = (69 + Bear) + (1004 + Bear) + 386
Tiger = 1379 + 2Bear

5. **Calculate the number of Elephant:**
Elephant = 750 + Tiger
Elephant = 750 + (1379 + 2Bear)
Elephant = 2129 + 2Bear

**Answer: Elephant = 2129 + 2Bear**<eos>
Define Deer as z; so z = 386. Define Wolf as N; U = z = 386; so N = 171 + U = 171 + 386 = 557. Define Raccoon as c; j = N + z = 557 + 386 = 943; so c = 718 + j = 718 + 943 = 1661. Define Bear as A; so A = c + N = 1661 + 557 = 2218. Define Fox as r; F = A = 2218; so r = 69 + F = 69 + 2218 = 2287. Define Tiger as y; d = r + c = 2287 + 1661 = 3948; so y = d + z = 3948 + 386 = 4334. Define Elephant as H; T = y + A = 4334 + 2218 = 6552; so H = 750 + T = 750 + 6552 = 7302. Answer: 7302.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 75 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Parrot, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 123 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 817.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Eagle, the number of Owl, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals 404 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Owl = 75 + (Eagle + Parrot + Crow) = 75 + (404 + 817 + Crow) = 75 + 1221 + Crow = 1326 + Crow.
- The number of Crow = Parrot = 817.
- The number of Blue Jay = 123 + Owl = 123 + (1326 + Crow) = 1449 + Crow.
- The number of Sparrow = Blue Jay + Eagle + Owl + Parrot = 1449 + Crow + 404 + 1326 + 817 = 3596 + Crow.

**Answer: 3596 + Crow**<eos>
Define Parrot as y; so y = 817. Define Crow as T; so T = y = 817. Define Eagle as n; Y = T + y = 817 + 817 = 1634; so n = 404 + Y = 404 + 1634 = 2038. Define Owl as x; H = n + y = 2038 + 817 = 2855; k = H + T = 2855 + 817 = 3672; so x = 75 + k = 75 + 3672 = 3747. Define Blue Jay as e; V = x = 3747; so e = 123 + V = 123 + 3747 = 3870. Define Sparrow as p; d = e + n = 3870 + 2038 = 5908; U = d + x = 5908 + 3747 = 9655; so p = U + y = 9655 + 817 = 10472. Answer: 10472.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 502 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Sparrow equals 518 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 820.
- The number of Eagle equals 645 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Crow, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 77 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Crow equals 693 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Parrot:
Number of Parrot = 77 + (Number of Crow + Number of Blue Jay)
= 77 + (693 + Number of Blue Jay)
= 77 + 693 + Number of Blue Jay
= 770 + Number of Blue Jay

- We can also calculate the number of Sparrow:
Number of Sparrow = 518 + (Number of Owl + Number of Crow)
= 518 + (502 + Number of Parrot)
= 518 + 502 + 770 + Number of Blue Jay
= 1790 + Number of Blue Jay

- Finally, we can calculate the number of Eagle:
Number of Eagle = 645 + (Number of Sparrow + Number of Crow + Number of Parrot)
= 645 + (1790 + Number of Blue Jay + 693 + Number of Blue Jay + 770 + Number of Blue Jay)
= 645 + 3253 + 3 * Number of Blue Jay
= 3898 + 3 * Number of Blue Jay

**Answer: 3898 + 3 * Number of Blue Jay**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as R; so R = 820. Define Crow as M; g = R = 820; so M = 693 + g = 693 + 820 = 1513. Define Parrot as N; s = M + R = 1513 + 820 = 2333; so N = 77 + s = 77 + 2333 = 2410. Define Owl as p; y = N = 2410; so p = 502 + y = 502 + 2410 = 2912. Define Sparrow as V; x = p + M = 2912 + 1513 = 4425; so V = 518 + x = 518 + 4425 = 4943. Define Eagle as T; B = V + M = 4943 + 1513 = 6456; e = B + N = 6456 + 2410 = 8866; so T = 645 + e = 645 + 8866 = 9511. Answer: 9511.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals 502 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of sparrow equals 518 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of crow.
- the number of blue jay equals 820.
- the number of eagle equals 645 plus the sum of the number of sparrow, the number of crow, and the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 77 plus the sum of the number of crow and the number of blue jay.
- the number of crow equals 693 plus the number of blue jay.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of parrot:
number of parrot = 77 + (number of crow + number of blue jay)
= 77 + (693 + number of blue jay)
= 77 + 693 + number of blue jay
= 770 + number of blue jay

- we can also calculate the number of sparrow:
number of sparrow = 518 + (number of owl + number of crow)
= 518 + (502 + number of parrot)
= 518 + 502 + 770 + number of blue jay
= 1790 + number of blue jay

- finally, we can calculate the number of eagle:
number of eagle = 645 + (number of sparrow + number of crow + number of parrot)
= 645 + (1790 + number of blue jay + 693 + number of blue jay + 770 + number of blue jay)
= 645 + 3253 + 3 * number of blue jay
= 3898 + 3 * number of blue jay

**answer: 3898 + 3 * number of blue jay**<eos>

- The number of Elephant equals 307 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Bear.
- The number of Raccoon equals 784 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 244 plus the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Deer = 599 + (Elephant + Bear + Fox) = 599 + (x + 90 + 244) = 599 + x + 334 = 933 + x
- The number of Wolf = Deer + Bear + Elephant = 933 + x + 90 + x = 1023 + 2x
- The number of Raccoon = 784 + Wolf = 784 + 1023 + 2x = 1707 + 2x

**Answer: Answer: 1707 + 2x**<eos>
Define Bear as D; so D = 90. Define Fox as J; i = D = 90; so J = 244 + i = 244 + 90 = 334. Define Elephant as v; o = J + D = 334 + 90 = 424; so v = 307 + o = 307 + 424 = 731. Define Deer as C; T = v + D = 731 + 90 = 821; s = T + J = 821 + 334 = 1155; so C = 599 + s = 599 + 1155 = 1754. Define Wolf as q; X = C + D = 1754 + 90 = 1844; so q = X + v = 1844 + 731 = 2575. Define Raccoon as V; O = q = 2575; so V = 784 + O = 784 + 2575 = 3359. Answer: 3359.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 40 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Eagle, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Crow equals 948 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Sparrow equals 115 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 587 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 796 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 49.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl:
Owl = 40 + Crow + Eagle + Sparrow
Owl = 40 + 948 + 49 + 115
Owl = 1112

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Parrot:
Parrot = 796 + Owl
Parrot = 796 + 1112
Parrot = 1908

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Blue Jay:
Blue Jay = 587 + Parrot + Eagle
Blue Jay = 587 + 1908 + 49
Blue Jay = 2544

**Answer: 2544**<eos>
Define Eagle as n; so n = 49. Define Sparrow as z; J = n = 49; so z = 115 + J = 115 + 49 = 164. Define Crow as u; K = z + n = 164 + 49 = 213; so u = 948 + K = 948 + 213 = 1161. Define Owl as e; a = u + n = 1161 + 49 = 1210; B = a + z = 1210 + 164 = 1374; so e = 40 + B = 40 + 1374 = 1414. Define Parrot as r; g = e = 1414; so r = 796 + g = 796 + 1414 = 2210. Define Blue Jay as S; Y = r + n = 2210 + 49 = 2259; so S = 587 + Y = 587 + 2259 = 2846. Answer: 2846.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Eagle, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 201 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Owl equals 378 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Sparrow equals 12 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Crow, the number of Eagle, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Eagle equals 403.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Parrot as:
Parrot = Crow + Eagle + Owl
Parrot = 201 + 403 + 378
Parrot = 1082

- We can also calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Sparrow = 12 + (Owl + Eagle)
Sparrow = 12 + (378 + 403)
Sparrow = 783

- The number of Blue Jay is:
Blue Jay = Parrot + Crow + Eagle + Sparrow
Blue Jay = 1082 + 201 + 403 + 783
Blue Jay = 2469

**Answer: 2469**<eos>
Define Eagle as T; so T = 403. Define Owl as z; L = T = 403; so z = 378 + L = 378 + 403 = 781. Define Sparrow as q; t = z + T = 781 + 403 = 1184; so q = 12 + t = 12 + 1184 = 1196. Define Crow as H; f = q = 1196; so H = 201 + f = 201 + 1196 = 1397. Define Parrot as P; F = H + T = 1397 + 403 = 1800; so P = F + z = 1800 + 781 = 2581. Define Blue Jay as I; e = P + H = 2581 + 1397 = 3978; Z = e + T = 3978 + 403 = 4381; so I = Z + q = 4381 + 1196 = 5577. Answer: 5577.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 349 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 728 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Hawk equals 298 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Crow, the number of Eagle, and the number of Hawk.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Crow and Eagle:
    - Crow = 349 + Eagle + Owl = 349 + 728 + 506 = 1583
    - Eagle = 728 + Owl = 728 + 506 = 1234

- Then we can calculate the number of Hawk:
    - Hawk = 298 + Crow + Owl + Eagle = 298 + 1583 + 506 + 1234 = 3611

- The number of Blue Jay is:
    - Blue Jay = Eagle + Hawk = 1234 + 3611 = 4845

- The number of Sparrow is:
    - Sparrow = Hawk + Owl = 3611 + 506 = 4117

- Finally, the number of Parrot is:
    - Parrot = Sparrow + Crow + Eagle + Hawk = 4117 + 1583 + 1234 + 3611 = 11345

**Answer: 11345**<eos>
Define Owl as F; so F = 506. Define Eagle as P; s = F = 506; so P = 728 + s = 728 + 506 = 1234. Define Crow as H; W = P + F = 1234 + 506 = 1740; so H = 349 + W = 349 + 1740 = 2089. Define Hawk as h; G = H + F = 2089 + 506 = 2595; n = G + P = 2595 + 1234 = 3829; so h = 298 + n = 298 + 3829 = 4127. Define Sparrow as y; so y = h + F = 4127 + 506 = 4633. Define Parrot as Y; a = y + H = 4633 + 2089 = 6722; u = a + P = 6722 + 1234 = 7956; so Y = u + h = 7956 + 4127 = 12083. Answer: 12083.

- The number of Blue Jay is 514 + 1831 = 2345.
- The number of Parrot is 133 + 2345 + 1219 = 3697.

**Answer: 3697**<eos>
Define Crow as K; so K = 848. Define Sparrow as u; l = K = 848; so u = 371 + l = 371 + 848 = 1219. Define Owl as t; k = u + K = 1219 + 848 = 2067; so t = 195 + k = 195 + 2067 = 2262. Define Eagle as v; U = t = 2262; so v = 788 + U = 788 + 2262 = 3050. Define Blue Jay as D; I = v + K = 3050 + 848 = 3898; so D = 514 + I = 514 + 3898 = 4412. Define Parrot as i; c = D + u = 4412 + 1219 = 5631; C = c + t = 5631 + 2262 = 7893; so i = 133 + C = 133 + 7893 = 8026. Answer: 8026.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals 339 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Hawk, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Sparrow equals 549.
- The number of Hawk equals 668 plus the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Owl equals the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Sparrow equals 549.
- Therefore, the number of Blue Jay equals 549 + number of Parrot + number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Blue Jay, so the number of Owl equals 549 + number of Parrot + number of Eagle.

**Answer: 549 + number of Parrot + number of Eagle**<eos>
Define Sparrow as l; so l = 549. Define Hawk as D; o = l = 549; so D = 668 + o = 668 + 549 = 1217. Define Parrot as w; so w = D + l = 1217 + 549 = 1766. Define Crow as Q; C = w + l = 1766 + 549 = 2315; so Q = C + D = 2315 + 1217 = 3532. Define Eagle as k; f = Q + D = 3532 + 1217 = 4749; d = f + w = 4749 + 1766 = 6515; so k = 339 + d = 339 + 6515 = 6854. Define Blue Jay as W; U = k + l = 6854 + 549 = 7403; so W = U + w = 7403 + 1766 = 9169. Define Owl as x; so x = W = 9169. Answer: 9169.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals the number of blue jay.
- the number of parrot equals the sum of the number of hawk and the number of sparrow.
- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of eagle, the number of sparrow, and the number of parrot.
- the number of eagle equals 339 plus the sum of the number of crow, the number of hawk, and the number of parrot.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of parrot, the number of sparrow, and the number of hawk.
- the number of sparrow equals 549.
- the number of hawk equals 668 plus the number of sparrow.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we know that the number of owl equals the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of eagle, the number of sparrow, and the number of parrot.
- the number of sparrow equals 549.
- therefore, the number of blue jay equals 549 + number of parrot + number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals the number of blue jay, so the number of owl equals 549 + number of parrot + number of eagle.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals the number of Horse.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Horse, the number of Elephant, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Tiger equals 939 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Bear.
- The number of Horse equals the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Lion.
- The number of Lion equals 61 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 855.
- The number of Bear equals 707 plus the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 718 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Lion.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Elephant equals the number of Horse. Let's assume both are x.
- The number of Deer is x + x + Wolf = 2x + Wolf.
- The number of Tiger is 939 + Raccoon + Bear.
- The number of Horse is 939 + Raccoon + Bear - Lion.
- The number of Lion is 61 + Fox.
- The number of Fox is 855.
- The number of Bear is 707 + Lion + Fox.
- The number of Wolf is 718 + Elephant.

**Substituting the values:**

- x = Horse = Elephant
- Deer = 2x + Wolf = 2x + Wolf
- Tiger = 939 + Raccoon + Bear = 939 + x + 707 + Lion + Fox
- Horse = 939 + Raccoon + Bear - Lion = 939 + x + 707 + Lion + Fox - Lion
- Lion = 61 + Fox
- Fox = 855
- Bear = 707 + Lion + Fox
- Wolf = 718 + Elephant = 718 + x

**Solving for Wolf:**

- Wolf = 718 + x = 718 + Horse
- **Answer: Wolf = Horse + 718**<eos>
Define Fox as Q; so Q = 855. Define Lion as r; l = Q = 855; so r = 61 + l = 61 + 855 = 916. Define Bear as z; s = r + Q = 916 + 855 = 1771; so z = 707 + s = 707 + 1771 = 2478. Define Raccoon as U; so U = z + r = 2478 + 916 = 3394. Define Tiger as V; A = U + z = 3394 + 2478 = 5872; so V = 939 + A = 939 + 5872 = 6811. Define Horse as o; so o = V + r = 6811 + 916 = 7727. Define Elephant as F; so F = o = 7727. Define Wolf as c; v = F = 7727; so c = 718 + v = 718 + 7727 = 8445. Answer: 8445.
**arguments:**

- the number of elephant equals the number of horse.
- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of horse, the number of elephant, and the number of wolf.
- the number of tiger equals 939 plus the sum of the number of raccoon and the number of bear.

- the number of deer is x + x + wolf = 2x + wolf.
- the number of tiger is 939 + raccoon + bear.
- the number of horse is 939 + raccoon + bear - lion.
- the number of lion is 61 + fox.
- the number of fox is 855.
- the number of bear is 707 + lion + fox.
- the number of wolf is 718 + elephant.

**substituting the values:**

- x = horse = elephant
- deer = 2x + wolf = 2x + wolf
- tiger = 939 + raccoon + bear = 939 + x + 707 + lion + fox
- horse = 939 + raccoon + bear - lion = 939 + x + 707 + lion + fox - lion
- lion = 61 + fox
- fox = 855
- bear = 707 + lion + fox
- wolf = 718 + elephant = 718 + x

**solving for wolf:**

- wolf = 718 + x = 718 + horse

- The number of Deer is 563 + 2602 = 3165.

**Answer: 3165**<eos>
Define Wolf as R; so R = 873. Define Raccoon as G; m = R = 873; so G = 856 + m = 856 + 873 = 1729. Define Bear as k; P = G + R = 1729 + 873 = 2602; so k = 51 + P = 51 + 2602 = 2653. Define Fox as U; so U = k = 2653. Define Elephant as N; s = U + R = 2653 + 873 = 3526; F = s + k = 3526 + 2653 = 6179; so N = 74 + F = 74 + 6179 = 6253. Define Deer as c; b = N + G = 6253 + 1729 = 7982; o = b + U = 7982 + 2653 = 10635; so c = 563 + o = 563 + 10635 = 11198. Answer: 11198.

- The number of Sparrow equals the number of Crow.
- The number of Hawk equals 694 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Owl equals the number of Eagle = x.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Peacock = x + 370.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Owl = 694 + x.
- The number of Sparrow equals the number of Crow = 694 + x.

**Answer: 694 + x**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as o; so o = 287. Define Peacock as T; C = o = 287; so T = 370 + C = 370 + 287 = 657. Define Parrot as v; so v = T = 657. Define Eagle as w; so w = v + T = 657 + 657 = 1314. Define Owl as l; so l = w = 1314. Define Penguin as N; G = l + v = 1314 + 657 = 1971; so N = G + w = 1971 + 1314 = 3285. Define Hawk as K; t = N + v = 3285 + 657 = 3942; so K = 694 + t = 694 + 3942 = 4636. Define Crow as e; so e = K + l = 4636 + 1314 = 5950. Define Sparrow as V; so V = e = 5950. Answer: 5950.
**arguments:**

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 801 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 74 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Sparrow equals 276 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 738 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Eagle, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 72.
- The number of Eagle equals 943 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Crow as:
Crow = 801 + Parrot + Owl
- We can also calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Blue Jay = 74 + Owl
- And the number of Sparrow as:
Sparrow = 276 + Eagle + Owl
- From the given equations, we can solve for the number of Parrot as:
Parrot = 738 + Sparrow + Eagle + Blue Jay
- Substituting the expressions for Sparrow and Blue Jay into the equation for Parrot, we get:
Parrot = 738 + (276 + Eagle + Owl) + Eagle + Owl
- Simplifying this equation, we get:
Parrot = 1014 + 2*Eagle + 2*Owl
- Finally, we can substitute the value of Owl (72) and solve for the number of Crow:
Crow = 801 + 1014 + 2*Eagle + 2*72
- Therefore, the number of Crow is:
**Answer: 1891**<eos>
Define Owl as d; so d = 72. Define Blue Jay as L; W = d = 72; so L = 74 + W = 74 + 72 = 146. Define Eagle as h; I = L = 146; so h = 943 + I = 943 + 146 = 1089. Define Sparrow as D; k = h + d = 1089 + 72 = 1161; so D = 276 + k = 276 + 1161 = 1437. Define Parrot as O; A = D + h = 1437 + 1089 = 2526; p = A + L = 2526 + 146 = 2672; so O = 738 + p = 738 + 2672 = 3410. Define Crow as g; a = O + d = 3410 + 72 = 3482; so g = 801 + a = 801 + 3482 = 4283. Answer: 4283.
**arguments:**

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow is 350.
- The number of Owl is 198 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Eagle is 398 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay is the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot is the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Sparrow, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow is 619 plus the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Eagle is 398 + (350 + 619) = 1377.
- The number of Owl is 198 + (350 + 1377) = 1815.
- The number of Blue Jay is 1815 + 350 = 2165.
- The number of Parrot is 2165 + 350 + 1815 + 1377 = 6327.

**Answer: 6327**<eos>
Define Sparrow as w; so w = 350. Define Crow as F; h = w = 350; so F = 619 + h = 619 + 350 = 969. Define Eagle as x; P = F + w = 969 + 350 = 1319; so x = 398 + P = 398 + 1319 = 1717. Define Owl as b; M = x + w = 1717 + 350 = 2067; B = M + F = 2067 + 969 = 3036; so b = 198 + B = 198 + 3036 = 3234. Define Blue Jay as A; so A = b + w = 3234 + 350 = 3584. Define Parrot as y; V = A + w = 3584 + 350 = 3934; Q = V + b = 3934 + 3234 = 7168; so y = Q + x = 7168 + 1717 = 8885. Answer: 8885.

- The number of Raccoon is 770 + 859 + 1529 = 3167.
- The number of Fox is 275 + 3167 = 3442.

**Answer: 3442**<eos>
Define Bear as d; so d = 859. Define Wolf as p; V = d = 859; so p = 670 + V = 670 + 859 = 1529. Define Deer as k; q = p + d = 1529 + 859 = 2388; so k = 398 + q = 398 + 2388 = 2786. Define Elephant as G; u = k + d = 2786 + 859 = 3645; t = u + p = 3645 + 1529 = 5174; so G = 770 + t = 770 + 5174 = 5944. Define Raccoon as L; so L = G + p = 5944 + 1529 = 7473. Define Fox as C; r = L + d = 7473 + 859 = 8332; z = r + G = 8332 + 5944 = 14276; so C = 275 + z = 275 + 14276 = 14551. Answer: 14551.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 888 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Wolf equals 245 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 986.
- The number of Tiger equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals 828 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 187 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 283 plus the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Tiger as 986.
- Since the number of Tiger equals the number of Deer, the number of Deer is also 986.
- From the equation for the number of Wolf, we can calculate the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Deer as 245 + 986 = 1231.
- Therefore, the number of Wolf is 1231 - 986 = 245.
- From the equation for the number of Bear, we can calculate the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Tiger as 888 - 245 = 643.
- Therefore, the number of Bear is 888 - 643 = 245.
- From the equation for the number of Fox, we can calculate the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Deer as 828 + 986 = 1814.
- Therefore, the number of Fox is 828 + 1814 - 986 = 1656.
- From the equation for the number of Raccoon, we can calculate the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Deer as 1656 + 986 = 2642.
- Therefore, the number of Raccoon is 187 + 2642 = **3829**.

**Answer: 3829**<eos>
Define Deer as E; so E = 986. Define Tiger as z; so z = E = 986. Define Wolf as o; g = z + E = 986 + 986 = 1972; so o = 245 + g = 245 + 1972 = 2217. Define Bear as e; x = o + z = 2217 + 986 = 3203; so e = 888 + x = 888 + 3203 = 4091. Define Elephant as Z; w = e = 4091; so Z = 283 + w = 283 + 4091 = 4374. Define Fox as m; s = Z + E = 4374 + 986 = 5360; so m = 828 + s = 828 + 5360 = 6188. Define Raccoon as F; P = m + E = 6188 + 986 = 7174; so F = 187 + P = 187 + 7174 = 7361. Answer: 7361.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals 846 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals 3.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Elephant, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 712 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals 845 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 322 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear:
    - The number of Wolf equals 322 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Elephant.
    - The number of Raccoon equals 846 plus the number of Elephant.
    - The number of Elephant equals 3.
    - Therefore, the number of Wolf equals 322 + (845 + 3) + (846 + 3) = 2134.
    - The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Elephant, and the number of Fox.
    - Therefore, the number of Bear equals 2134 + 3 + 845 = 3022.

**Answer: 3022**<eos>
Define Elephant as w; so w = 3. Define Raccoon as D; E = w = 3; so D = 846 + E = 846 + 3 = 849. Define Deer as i; U = D + w = 849 + 3 = 852; so i = 712 + U = 712 + 852 = 1564. Define Fox as f; b = i = 1564; so f = 845 + b = 845 + 1564 = 2409. Define Wolf as a; P = f + D = 2409 + 849 = 3258; s = P + w = 3258 + 3 = 3261; so a = 322 + s = 322 + 3261 = 3583. Define Bear as Z; R = a + w = 3583 + 3 = 3586; so Z = R + f = 3586 + 2409 = 5995. Answer: 5995.

- The number of Sparrow equals 970 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Hawk equals 337 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 720.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Hawk is 337 + (number of Blue Jay) + (number of Parrot) = 337 + (number of Blue Jay) + 720 = 1057 + (number of Blue Jay).
- The number of Eagle is 262 + (number of Sparrow) + (number of Hawk) = 262 + 970 + (1057 + (number of Blue Jay)) = 2089 + (number of Blue Jay).

**Answer: 2089 + (number of Blue Jay)**<eos>
Define Parrot as y; so y = 720. Define Blue Jay as r; w = y = 720; so r = 481 + w = 481 + 720 = 1201. Define Hawk as z; c = r + y = 1201 + 720 = 1921; so z = 337 + c = 337 + 1921 = 2258. Define Crow as P; so P = z + r = 2258 + 1201 = 3459. Define Owl as h; g = P + r = 3459 + 1201 = 4660; so h = g + y = 4660 + 720 = 5380. Define Sparrow as M; Q = h = 5380; so M = 970 + Q = 970 + 5380 = 6350. Define Eagle as V; e = M + z = 6350 + 2258 = 8608; so V = 262 + e = 262 + 8608 = 8870. Answer: 8870.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 262 plus the sum of the number of sparrow and the number of hawk.
- the number of sparrow equals 970 plus the number of owl.
- the number of hawk equals 337 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 720.

**calculation:**

- the number of hawk is 337 + (number of blue jay) + (number of parrot) = 337 + (number of blue jay) + 720 = 1057 + (number of blue jay).
- the number of eagle is 262 + (number of sparrow) + (number of hawk) = 262 + 970 + (1057 + (number of blue jay)) = 2089 + (number of blue jay).

**answer: 2089 + (number of blue jay)**<eos>

- The number of Wolf equals 110.
- The number of Raccoon equals 983 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Fox equals 119 plus the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Lion.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear = the number of Wolf = 110.
- The number of Elephant = the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Wolf = 110 + 110 = 220.
- The number of Deer = the number of Elephant = 220.
- The number of Tiger = the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Bear, and the number of Elephant = 983 + 110 + 220 = 1313.
- The number of Lion = the number of Deer = 220.
- The number of Fox = 119 + the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Lion = 119 + 1313 + 983 + 220 = 2625.

**Answer: 2625**<eos>
Define Wolf as B; so B = 110. Define Bear as h; so h = B = 110. Define Elephant as D; so D = h + B = 110 + 110 = 220. Define Deer as Z; so Z = D = 220. Define Lion as H; so H = Z = 220. Define Raccoon as l; w = H = 220; so l = 983 + w = 983 + 220 = 1203. Define Tiger as P; f = l + h = 1203 + 110 = 1313; so P = f + D = 1313 + 220 = 1533. Define Fox as e; x = P + l = 1533 + 1203 = 2736; v = x + H = 2736 + 220 = 2956; so e = 119 + v = 119 + 2956 = 3075. Answer: 3075.

- The number of Parrot equals 871 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Sparrow equals 77 plus the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Crow, and the number of Hawk.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Hawk is 224 + 872 = 1096.
- The number of Eagle is the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Hawk. Therefore, the number of Eagle is 1096 + 77 = 1173.

**Answer: 1173**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as U; so U = 872. Define Hawk as f; D = U = 872; so f = 224 + D = 224 + 872 = 1096. Define Crow as y; m = f = 1096; so y = 399 + m = 399 + 1096 = 1495. Define Parrot as r; u = y + U = 1495 + 872 = 2367; X = u + f = 2367 + 1096 = 3463; so r = 871 + X = 871 + 3463 = 4334. Define Sparrow as E; v = r + y = 4334 + 1495 = 5829; c = v + f = 5829 + 1096 = 6925; so E = 77 + c = 77 + 6925 = 7002. Define Eagle as a; so a = E + f = 7002 + 1096 = 8098. Answer: 8098.

- The number of Sparrow equals 665 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 545 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 465 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Owl, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Crow, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 649.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Eagle = 897 + (Crow + Owl) = 897 + (545 + Owl) = 897 + 545 + Owl = 1442 + Owl
- The number of Sparrow = 665 + Parrot = 665 + 465 = 1130
- The number of Crow = 545 + Owl = 545 + 649 = 1194
- The number of Parrot = 465 + Eagle + Owl + Crow = 465 + (1442 + Owl) + 1194 = 2631 + Owl
- The number of Blue Jay = Sparrow + Crow + Owl = 1130 + 1194 + 649 = 2973

**Answer: 2973**<eos>
Define Owl as V; so V = 649. Define Crow as g; r = V = 649; so g = 545 + r = 545 + 649 = 1194. Define Eagle as C; q = g + V = 1194 + 649 = 1843; so C = 897 + q = 897 + 1843 = 2740. Define Parrot as u; P = C + V = 2740 + 649 = 3389; S = P + g = 3389 + 1194 = 4583; so u = 465 + S = 465 + 4583 = 5048. Define Sparrow as D; j = u = 5048; so D = 665 + j = 665 + 5048 = 5713. Define Blue Jay as G; H = D + g = 5713 + 1194 = 6907; so G = H + V = 6907 + 649 = 7556. Answer: 7556.

- The number of Parrot equals 715 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 962 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Eagle is 433 + (Crow + Owl + Parrot) = 433 + (962 + 569 + 715) = 433 + 2256 = 2689.
- The number of Sparrow is 420 + Eagle = 420 + 2689 = 3109.
- The number of Blue Jay is Sparrow + Crow + Eagle = 3109 + 962 + 2689 = 6770.

**Answer: 6770**<eos>
Define Owl as M; so M = 569. Define Parrot as c; b = M = 569; so c = 715 + b = 715 + 569 = 1284. Define Crow as d; T = c + M = 1284 + 569 = 1853; so d = 962 + T = 962 + 1853 = 2815. Define Eagle as P; j = d + M = 2815 + 569 = 3384; Z = j + c = 3384 + 1284 = 4668; so P = 433 + Z = 433 + 4668 = 5101. Define Sparrow as F; z = P = 5101; so F = 420 + z = 420 + 5101 = 5521. Define Blue Jay as l; W = F + d = 5521 + 2815 = 8336; so l = W + P = 8336 + 5101 = 13437. Answer: 13437.

- The number of Crow equals 997 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 678.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle as:
354 = Eagle + Hawk + Blue Jay
Therefore, Hawk + Blue Jay = 354 - Eagle.
- We can also calculate the number of Owl as:
Owl = Crow + Parrot + Blue Jay
Therefore, Crow + Parrot = Owl - Blue Jay.
- Substituting the above equations, we get:
Hawk + Blue Jay = 354 - (Owl - Blue Jay)
Hawk = 354 - Owl.
- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Sparrow = Eagle + Parrot
Therefore, Sparrow = 354 - Owl + 678.
- Substituting the value of Owl, we get:
Sparrow = 354 - (354 - Blue Jay) + 678
Sparrow = 678 + Blue Jay.
- Therefore, the number of Sparrow is 678 + the number of Blue Jay.

**Answer: Answer: 678 + the number of Blue Jay**<eos>
Define Parrot as Q; so Q = 678. Define Blue Jay as E; v = Q = 678; so E = 406 + v = 406 + 678 = 1084. Define Crow as L; z = E + Q = 1084 + 678 = 1762; so L = 997 + z = 997 + 1762 = 2759. Define Owl as S; o = L + Q = 2759 + 678 = 3437; so S = o + E = 3437 + 1084 = 4521. Define Hawk as C; P = S = 4521; so C = 423 + P = 423 + 4521 = 4944. Define Eagle as n; F = C + E = 4944 + 1084 = 6028; so n = 354 + F = 354 + 6028 = 6382. Define Sparrow as H; so H = n + Q = 6382 + 678 = 7060. Answer: 7060.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 354 plus the sum of the number of hawk and the number of blue jay.
- the number of hawk equals 423 plus the number of owl.
- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of eagle and the number of parrot.
- the number of blue jay equals 406 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of crow, the number of parrot, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of crow equals 997 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 678.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of eagle as:
354 = eagle + hawk + blue jay
therefore, hawk + blue jay = 354 - eagle.
- we can also calculate the number of owl as:
owl = crow + parrot + blue jay
therefore, crow + parrot = owl - blue jay.
- substituting the above equations, we get:
hawk + blue jay = 354 - (owl - blue jay)
hawk = 354 - owl.
- from the given information, we can calculate the number of sparrow as:
sparrow = eagle + parrot
therefore, sparrow = 354 - owl + 678.
- substituting the value of owl, we get:
sparrow = 354 - (354 - blue jay) + 678
sparrow = 678 + blue jay.
- therefore, the number of sparrow is 678 + the number of blue jay.

**answer: answer: 678 + the number of blue jay**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Deer.
- The number of Tiger equals 936 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Elephant, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Fox, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Wolf equals 901 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals 704 plus the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger equals 936 + Deer = 936 + (Raccoon + Elephant + Fox)
- The number of Bear equals Tiger + Deer = (936 + Raccoon + Elephant + Fox) + Deer
- The number of Bear equals (936 + Raccoon + Elephant + 704 + Elephant) + Deer
- The number of Bear equals 1640 + Raccoon + 2*Elephant + Deer

**Answer: 1640 + Raccoon + 2*Elephant + Deer**<eos>
Define Elephant as k; so k = 391. Define Fox as E; C = k = 391; so E = 704 + C = 704 + 391 = 1095. Define Wolf as z; X = E + k = 1095 + 391 = 1486; so z = 901 + X = 901 + 1486 = 2387. Define Raccoon as S; q = z + E = 2387 + 1095 = 3482; so S = q + k = 3482 + 391 = 3873. Define Deer as I; y = S + k = 3873 + 391 = 4264; so I = y + E = 4264 + 1095 = 5359. Define Tiger as O; K = I = 5359; so O = 936 + K = 936 + 5359 = 6295. Define Bear as g; so g = O + I = 6295 + 5359 = 11654. Answer: 11654.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 116 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Deer, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals 516 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 883 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 762 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Wolf equals 912 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 374.

**Calculation:**

- From the equation "The number of Bear equals 116 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Deer, and the number of Wolf.", we have:
Number of Bear = 116 + Number of Fox + Number of Deer + Number of Wolf
- From the equation "The number of Raccoon equals 516 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Fox.", we have:
Number of Raccoon = 516 + Number of Bear + Number of Fox
- From the equation "The number of Fox equals 883 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.", we have:
Number of Fox = 883 + Number of Wolf + Number of Deer
- From the equation "The number of Elephant equals 762 plus the number of Raccoon.", we have:
Number of Elephant = 762 + Number of Raccoon
- From the equation "The number of Wolf equals 912 plus the number of Deer.", we have:
Number of Wolf = 912 + Number of Deer
- From the equation "The number of Deer equals 374.", we have:
Number of Deer = 374

**Substituting the above equations into each other, we get:**

Number of Bear = 116 + 883 + 374 + Number of Wolf
Number of Raccoon = 516 + 116 + 883
Number of Elephant = 762 + 516 + 883

**Solving for the unknowns:**

Number of Bear = 1523 + Number of Wolf
Number of Raccoon = 1032
Number of Elephant = 1545

**Therefore, the number of Elephant is 1545.**

**Answer: 1545**<eos>
Define Deer as U; so U = 374. Define Wolf as z; K = U = 374; so z = 912 + K = 912 + 374 = 1286. Define Fox as Q; p = z + U = 1286 + 374 = 1660; so Q = 883 + p = 883 + 1660 = 2543. Define Bear as y; I = Q + U = 2543 + 374 = 2917; d = I + z = 2917 + 1286 = 4203; so y = 116 + d = 116 + 4203 = 4319. Define Raccoon as Y; C = y + Q = 4319 + 2543 = 6862; so Y = 516 + C = 516 + 6862 = 7378. Define Elephant as f; J = Y = 7378; so f = 762 + J = 762 + 7378 = 8140. Answer: 8140.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 734 plus the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Parrot, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 491 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 288 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 272.
- The number of Sparrow equals 999 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Parrot, and the number of Crow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 734 + (Owl + Parrot + Crow)
- The number of Crow equals 491 + Eagle
- The number of Parrot equals 288 + (Crow + Eagle)
- The number of Eagle equals 272
- The number of Sparrow equals 999 + (Parrot + Eagle)
- The number of Owl equals Sparrow + Parrot + Crow

Substituting the value of Eagle, Crow, and Parrot from the previous equations, we get:

- The number of Blue Jay equals 734 + (Owl + 288 + (491 + Eagle) + Crow)
- The number of Owl equals (734 + 288 + 491 + Eagle + Crow) - Crow

Solving these equations, we get:

- The number of Blue Jay equals 1513
- The number of Owl equals 1425

**Answer: Answer: 1513**<eos>
Define Eagle as q; so q = 272. Define Crow as D; i = q = 272; so D = 491 + i = 491 + 272 = 763. Define Parrot as M; C = D + q = 763 + 272 = 1035; so M = 288 + C = 288 + 1035 = 1323. Define Sparrow as s; Q = M + q = 1323 + 272 = 1595; so s = 999 + Q = 999 + 1595 = 2594. Define Owl as P; g = s + M = 2594 + 1323 = 3917; so P = g + D = 3917 + 763 = 4680. Define Blue Jay as I; K = P + M = 4680 + 1323 = 6003; z = K + D = 6003 + 763 = 6766; so I = 734 + z = 734 + 6766 = 7500. Answer: 7500.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 738.
- The number of Deer equals 347 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals 413 plus the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Deer, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 182 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Fox equals 498 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon = Deer + Fox + Wolf = 347 + 498 + 738 = 1583.
- The number of Deer = 347 + Fox + Wolf = 347 + 498 + 738 = 1583.
- The number of Fox = 498 + Wolf = 498 + 738 = 1236.
- The number of Bear = 182 + Raccoon = 182 + 1583 = 1765.
- The number of Elephant = 413 + Bear + Deer + Fox = 413 + 1765 + 1583 + 1236 = 4717.

**Answer: 4717**<eos>
Define Wolf as t; so t = 738. Define Fox as a; w = t = 738; so a = 498 + w = 498 + 738 = 1236. Define Deer as z; G = a + t = 1236 + 738 = 1974; so z = 347 + G = 347 + 1974 = 2321. Define Raccoon as y; N = z + a = 2321 + 1236 = 3557; so y = N + t = 3557 + 738 = 4295. Define Bear as u; U = y = 4295; so u = 182 + U = 182 + 4295 = 4477. Define Elephant as o; O = u + z = 4477 + 2321 = 6798; Z = O + a = 6798 + 1236 = 8034; so o = 413 + Z = 413 + 8034 = 8447. Answer: 8447.
**arguments:**

- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of deer, the number of fox, and the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 738.
- the number of deer equals 347 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of wolf.

- the number of bear equals 182 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of fox equals 498 plus the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- the number of raccoon = deer + fox + wolf = 347 + 498 + 738 = 1583.
- the number of deer = 347 + fox + wolf = 347 + 498 + 738 = 1583.
- the number of fox = 498 + wolf = 498 + 738 = 1236.
- the number of bear = 182 + raccoon = 182 + 1583 = 1765.
- the number of elephant = 413 + bear + deer + fox = 413 + 1765 + 1583 + 1236 = 4717.

- The number of Elephant equals 761 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 736.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear is 314 + 736 = 1050.
- The number of Deer is 2 + (761 + 1050) = 1813.
- The number of Fox is 939 + 1813 = 2752.
- The number of Raccoon is 2752 + 1050 + 1813 = 5615.

**Answer: 5615**<eos>
Define Wolf as e; so e = 736. Define Bear as v; s = e = 736; so v = 314 + s = 314 + 736 = 1050. Define Elephant as l; X = v + e = 1050 + 736 = 1786; so l = 761 + X = 761 + 1786 = 2547. Define Deer as K; J = l + e = 2547 + 736 = 3283; B = J + v = 3283 + 1050 = 4333; so K = 2 + B = 2 + 4333 = 4335. Define Fox as d; h = K = 4335; so d = 939 + h = 939 + 4335 = 5274. Define Raccoon as t; O = d + v = 5274 + 1050 = 6324; so t = O + K = 6324 + 4335 = 10659. Answer: 10659.

- The number of Sparrow equals 456 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 131.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay is 131.
- The number of Eagle is 167 + 131 = 298.
- The number of Sparrow is 456 + 298 = 754.
- The number of Owl is 154 + 754 = 908.
- The number of Crow is 908 + 131 + 754 = 1793.
- The number of Hawk is 255 + 1793 = 2048.

**Answer: 2048**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as e; so e = 131. Define Eagle as Y; r = e = 131; so Y = 167 + r = 167 + 131 = 298. Define Parrot as T; so T = Y + e = 298 + 131 = 429. Define Sparrow as k; o = T + Y = 429 + 298 = 727; so k = 456 + o = 456 + 727 = 1183. Define Owl as E; R = k + Y = 1183 + 298 = 1481; so E = 154 + R = 154 + 1481 = 1635. Define Crow as W; M = E + e = 1635 + 131 = 1766; so W = M + k = 1766 + 1183 = 2949. Define Hawk as a; t = W = 2949; so a = 255 + t = 255 + 2949 = 3204. Answer: 3204.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 167 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of hawk equals 255 plus the number of crow.

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 744 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 337 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk equals 472 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Parrot, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 51.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals the number of Hawk.
- The number of Eagle equals 313 plus the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = 744 + (Number of Eagle + Number of Parrot)
- We can also calculate the number of Owl as:
Number of Owl = 337 + (Number of Blue Jay + Number of Sparrow)
- From the given information, we know that the number of Parrot is 51.
- We can calculate the number of Eagle as:
Number of Eagle = 313 + Number of Parrot
- We can calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Number of Blue Jay = Number of Crow
- We can calculate the number of Crow as:
Number of Crow = Number of Hawk
- We can calculate the number of Hawk as:
Number of Hawk = 472 + (Number of Sparrow + Number of Parrot + Number of Eagle)
- Substituting the values we know into the above equations, we get:
Number of Sparrow = 744 + (Number of Eagle + 51)
Number of Owl = 337 + (Number of Blue Jay + 744 + Number of Eagle)
Number of Hawk = 472 + (744 + 51 + Number of Eagle)
- We can simplify these equations to:
Number of Sparrow = 744 + Number of Eagle + 51
Number of Owl = 337 + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Eagle
Number of Hawk = 472 + 744 + Number of Eagle + 51
- We can further simplify these equations to:
Number of Sparrow = 795 + Number of Eagle
Number of Owl = 337 + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Eagle
Number of Hawk = 1216 + Number of Eagle
- We are given that the number of Blue Jay equals the number of Crow, so we can substitute the number of Crow for the number of Blue Jay in the equation for Number of Owl:
Number of Owl = 337 + Number of Crow + Number of Eagle
- We are also given that the number of Crow equals the number of Hawk, so we can substitute the number of Hawk for the number of Crow in the equation for Number of Owl:
Number of Owl = 337 + Hawk + Number of Eagle
- We can now solve for the number of Owl:
Number of Owl = 337 + 472 + Number of Eagle + Number of Eagle
Number of Owl = 809 + 2 * Number of Eagle
- We do not have any information about the number of Eagle, so we cannot calculate the number of Owl.

**Answer: Cannot be determined**<eos>
Define Parrot as J; so J = 51. Define Eagle as g; G = J = 51; so g = 313 + G = 313 + 51 = 364. Define Sparrow as L; e = g + J = 364 + 51 = 415; so L = 744 + e = 744 + 415 = 1159. Define Hawk as m; P = L + J = 1159 + 51 = 1210; D = P + g = 1210 + 364 = 1574; so m = 472 + D = 472 + 1574 = 2046. Define Crow as Z; so Z = m = 2046. Define Blue Jay as h; so h = Z = 2046. Define Owl as r; o = h + L = 2046 + 1159 = 3205; so r = 337 + o = 337 + 3205 = 3542. Answer: 3542.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 526 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 186.
- The number of Wolf equals 93 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Deer, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon equals 86 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Wolf, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Fox equals 404 plus the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the number of Wolf:**
   - Wolf = 93 + Raccoon + Deer + Fox
   - Wolf = 93 + 86 + 186 + Fox
   - Wolf = 282 + Fox

2. **Calculate the number of Raccoon:**
   - Raccoon = 86 + Fox + Deer
   - Raccoon = 86 + Fox + 186

3. **Calculate the number of Elephant:**
   - Elephant = 526 + Wolf
   - Elephant = 526 + (282 + Fox)
   - Elephant = 808 + Fox

4. **Calculate the number of Bear:**
   - Bear = Elephant + Wolf + Raccoon
   - Bear = (808 + Fox) + (282 + Fox) + (86 + Fox + 186)
   - Bear = 1176 + 3 * Fox

**Answer: 1176 + 3 * Fox**<eos>
Define Deer as W; so W = 186. Define Fox as r; z = W = 186; so r = 404 + z = 404 + 186 = 590. Define Raccoon as L; C = r + W = 590 + 186 = 776; so L = 86 + C = 86 + 776 = 862. Define Wolf as f; u = L + W = 862 + 186 = 1048; c = u + r = 1048 + 590 = 1638; so f = 93 + c = 93 + 1638 = 1731. Define Elephant as V; x = f = 1731; so V = 526 + x = 526 + 1731 = 2257. Define Bear as M; E = V + f = 2257 + 1731 = 3988; so M = E + L = 3988 + 862 = 4850. Answer: 4850.

- The number of Raccoon equals 952 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 341 plus the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Wolf, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon is 952 + 526 + 884 = 2362.
- The number of Elephant is 54 + 2362 = 2416.
- The number of Tiger is 2416 + 884 + 526 = 3826.
- The number of Wolf is 526 + 884 = 1410.
- The number of Bear is 3826 + 2416 = 6242.
- The number of Deer is 341 + 6242 + 2362 = 9965.

**Answer: 9965**<eos>
Define Fox as i; so i = 884. Define Wolf as u; x = i = 884; so u = 526 + x = 526 + 884 = 1410. Define Raccoon as W; X = u + i = 1410 + 884 = 2294; so W = 952 + X = 952 + 2294 = 3246. Define Elephant as z; t = W = 3246; so z = 54 + t = 54 + 3246 = 3300. Define Tiger as O; d = z + i = 3300 + 884 = 4184; so O = d + u = 4184 + 1410 = 5594. Define Bear as Z; so Z = O + z = 5594 + 3300 = 8894. Define Deer as Q; c = Z + u = 8894 + 1410 = 10304; E = c + W = 10304 + 3246 = 13550; so Q = 341 + E = 341 + 13550 = 13891. Answer: 13891.

**Answer: 1939**<eos>
Define Hawk as a; so a = 745. Define Blue Jay as U; t = a = 745; so U = 656 + t = 656 + 745 = 1401. Define Crow as W; so W = U + a = 1401 + 745 = 2146. Define Peacock as T; l = W + U = 2146 + 1401 = 3547; so T = 383 + l = 383 + 3547 = 3930. Define Penguin as D; so D = T + W = 3930 + 2146 = 6076. Define Parrot as R; S = D + a = 6076 + 745 = 6821; so R = 569 + S = 569 + 6821 = 7390. Define Owl as z; k = R = 7390; so z = 538 + k = 538 + 7390 = 7928. Define Sparrow as x; f = z + U = 7928 + 1401 = 9329; so x = f + a = 9329 + 745 = 10074. Answer: 10074.

- The number of Fox = 425 + Elephant
- The number of Elephant = Bear
- The number of Wolf = Fox + Raccoon + Bear + Deer = (425 + Elephant) + 372 + Bear + 372

**Answer:**

**Answer: The number of Lion is equal to the number of Wolf.**<eos>
Define Tiger as n; so n = 71. Define Deer as D; K = n = 71; so D = 372 + K = 372 + 71 = 443. Define Raccoon as U; so U = D = 443. Define Bear as Y; G = U + D = 443 + 443 = 886; so Y = G + n = 886 + 71 = 957. Define Elephant as I; so I = Y = 957. Define Fox as Q; N = I = 957; so Q = 425 + N = 425 + 957 = 1382. Define Wolf as b; E = Q + U = 1382 + 443 = 1825; L = E + Y = 1825 + 957 = 2782; so b = L + D = 2782 + 443 = 3225. Define Lion as x; so x = b = 3225. Answer: 3225.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 306 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals 972 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals 556 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Lion equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 552.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Lion, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 645 plus the number of Lion.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon = 556 + number of Elephant = 556 + x
- The number of Bear = 306 + Raccoon + Elephant = 306 + (556 + x) + x = 862 + 2x
- The number of Tiger = Bear + Lion + Elephant = 862 + 2x + Lion + x = 862 + 3x + Lion
- The number of Fox = 972 + Wolf = 972 + 552 = 1524
- The number of Lion = Fox = 1524
- The number of Elephant = Deer + Fox = x + 1524
- The number of Deer = 645 + Lion = 645 + 1524 = 2169

**Answer:** The number of Tiger is 862 + 3x = 862 + 3 * 1524 = 5186.<eos>
Define Wolf as G; so G = 552. Define Fox as g; v = G = 552; so g = 972 + v = 972 + 552 = 1524. Define Lion as X; so X = g = 1524. Define Deer as y; b = X = 1524; so y = 645 + b = 645 + 1524 = 2169. Define Elephant as M; so M = y + g = 2169 + 1524 = 3693. Define Raccoon as C; w = M = 3693; so C = 556 + w = 556 + 3693 = 4249. Define Bear as m; H = C + M = 4249 + 3693 = 7942; so m = 306 + H = 306 + 7942 = 8248. Define Tiger as h; E = m + X = 8248 + 1524 = 9772; so h = E + M = 9772 + 3693 = 13465. Answer: 13465.

- The number of Hawk equals 4.
- The number of Owl equals 906 plus the sum of the number of Peacock and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Penguin equals 45.
- The number of Sparrow equals 251.
- The number of Peacock equals 571 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Crow equals 898 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay = 280 + (Parrot + Owl)
- The number of Parrot = 45 + (Owl + Hawk)
- The number of Owl = 906 + (Peacock + Hawk)
- The number of Crow = 898 + (Eagle + Blue Jay)
- The number of Eagle = 11 + Blue Jay
- The number of Blue Jay = 280 + (45 + (Owl + Hawk))
- The number of Owl = 906 + (571 + Hawk)
- The number of Hawk = 4

**Solving the equations:**

- Blue Jay = 280 + (45 + (906 + 4)) = 1255
- Eagle = 11 + 1255 = 1266
- Parrot = 45 + (906 + 4) = 955
- Owl = 906 + (571 + 4) = 1481
- Crow = 898 + (1266 + 1255) = 2529

**Answer: 2529**<eos>
Define Hawk as v; so v = 4. Define Peacock as U; Q = v = 4; so U = 571 + Q = 571 + 4 = 575. Define Owl as p; Z = U + v = 575 + 4 = 579; so p = 906 + Z = 906 + 579 = 1485. Define Parrot as S; I = p + v = 1485 + 4 = 1489; so S = 45 + I = 45 + 1489 = 1534. Define Blue Jay as n; i = S + p = 1534 + 1485 = 3019; so n = 280 + i = 280 + 3019 = 3299. Define Eagle as b; s = n = 3299; so b = 11 + s = 11 + 3299 = 3310. Define Crow as d; t = b + n = 3310 + 3299 = 6609; so d = 898 + t = 898 + 6609 = 7507. Answer: 7507.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 322.
- The number of Crow equals 29 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Peacock.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 305 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Eagle equals 730 plus the number of Peacock.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Owl.
- The number of Peacock equals the number of Penguin.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Peacock, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Crow = 29 + (Eagle + Peacock)
- The number of Blue Jay = Hawk + Crow
- The number of Parrot = 305 + Sparrow
- The number of Owl = Crow + Peacock + Sparrow
- The number of Penguin = Parrot + Sparrow

Substituting the values of Sparrow, Eagle, and Peacock into the above equations, we get:

- The number of Crow = 29 + (730 + Peacock) = 759 + Peacock
- The number of Blue Jay = Hawk + 759 + Peacock
- The number of Parrot = 305 + 322 = 627
- The number of Owl = 759 + Peacock + 322
- The number of Penguin = 627 + 322

**Answer: 1051**

Therefore, the number of Blue Jay is 1051.<eos>
Define Sparrow as F; so F = 322. Define Parrot as e; q = F = 322; so e = 305 + q = 305 + 322 = 627. Define Penguin as z; so z = e + F = 627 + 322 = 949. Define Peacock as A; so A = z = 949. Define Eagle as p; f = A = 949; so p = 730 + f = 730 + 949 = 1679. Define Crow as I; L = p + A = 1679 + 949 = 2628; so I = 29 + L = 29 + 2628 = 2657. Define Owl as B; J = I + A = 2657 + 949 = 3606; so B = J + F = 3606 + 322 = 3928. Define Hawk as R; so R = B = 3928. Define Blue Jay as W; so W = R + I = 3928 + 2657 = 6585. Answer: 6585.
**arguments:**

- the number of sparrow equals 322.
- the number of crow equals 29 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of peacock.
- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of hawk and the number of crow.
- the number of parrot equals 305 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of eagle equals 730 plus the number of peacock.
- the number of hawk equals the number of owl.
- the number of peacock equals the number of penguin.
- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of crow, the number of peacock, and the number of sparrow.
- the number of penguin equals the sum of the number of parrot and the number of sparrow.

**calculation:**

- the number of crow = 29 + (eagle + peacock)
- the number of blue jay = hawk + crow
- the number of parrot = 305 + sparrow
- the number of owl = crow + peacock + sparrow
- the number of penguin = parrot + sparrow

substituting the values of sparrow, eagle, and peacock into the above equations, we get:

- the number of crow = 29 + (730 + peacock) = 759 + peacock
- the number of blue jay = hawk + 759 + peacock
- the number of parrot = 305 + 322 = 627
- the number of owl = 759 + peacock + 322
- the number of penguin = 627 + 322

Define Elephant as K; so K = 315. Define Wolf as i; X = K = 315; so i = 356 + X = 356 + 315 = 671. Define Lion as V; J = i + K = 671 + 315 = 986; so V = 489 + J = 489 + 986 = 1475. Define Fox as Z; A = V + K = 1475 + 315 = 1790; Y = A + i = 1790 + 671 = 2461; so Z = 926 + Y = 926 + 2461 = 3387. Define Tiger as B; so B = Z = 3387. Define Raccoon as I; so I = B + Z = 3387 + 3387 = 6774. Define Deer as C; k = I = 6774; so C = 427 + k = 427 + 6774 = 7201. Define Bear as f; so f = C = 7201. Answer: 7201.

- The number of Deer equals 336 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Horse, the number of Deer, the number of Bear, and the number of Lion.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Lion as follows:
Number of Lion = 671 + Number of Deer = 671 + 336 = 1007
- The number of Elephant is calculated as:
Number of Elephant = Number of Fox + Number of Tiger + Number of Lion = 0 + 0 + 1007 = 1007
- The number of Raccoon is equal to the number of Elephant:
Number of Raccoon = Number of Elephant = 1007

**Answer: 1007**<eos>
Define Bear as r; so r = 570. Define Deer as a; m = r = 570; so a = 336 + m = 336 + 570 = 906. Define Lion as J; b = a = 906; so J = 671 + b = 671 + 906 = 1577. Define Horse as C; so C = J + a = 1577 + 906 = 2483. Define Tiger as A; o = C + a = 2483 + 906 = 3389; D = o + r = 3389 + 570 = 3959; so A = D + J = 3959 + 1577 = 5536. Define Fox as H; so H = A = 5536. Define Elephant as l; j = H + A = 5536 + 5536 = 11072; so l = j + J = 11072 + 1577 = 12649. Define Raccoon as L; so L = l = 12649. Answer: 12649.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 114 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 585 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 249.
- The number of Eagle equals 84 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 608 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Sparrow equals 540 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay is 114 + (Crow + Owl + Eagle) = 114 + (x + 249 + 84) = 114 + x + 333 = x + 447.
- The number of Parrot is 585 + (Sparrow + Owl + Eagle) = 585 + (y + 249 + 84) = 585 + y + 333 = y + 918.
- The number of Sparrow is 540 + Blue Jay = 540 + (x + 447) = x + 987.

**Answer: Parrot = y + 918**<eos>
Define Owl as s; so s = 249. Define Eagle as x; e = s = 249; so x = 84 + e = 84 + 249 = 333. Define Crow as w; D = x + s = 333 + 249 = 582; so w = 608 + D = 608 + 582 = 1190. Define Blue Jay as q; p = w + s = 1190 + 249 = 1439; h = p + x = 1439 + 333 = 1772; so q = 114 + h = 114 + 1772 = 1886. Define Sparrow as N; X = q = 1886; so N = 540 + X = 540 + 1886 = 2426. Define Parrot as v; T = N + s = 2426 + 249 = 2675; u = T + x = 2675 + 333 = 3008; so v = 585 + u = 585 + 3008 = 3593. Answer: 3593.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Penguin equals 494 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 658 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Penguin, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 710 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 855.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = Number of Hawk + Number of Blue Jay
- We do not have any information about the number of Hawk, so we cannot calculate the number of Sparrow directly.
- However, we can calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Number of Blue Jay = 658 + Number of Owl
- We know that the number of Owl equals 855, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get:
Number of Blue Jay = 658 + 855 = 1513
- Therefore, the number of Sparrow is:
Number of Sparrow = Number of Hawk + 1513
- We still do not have any information about the number of Hawk, so we cannot calculate the number of Sparrow.

**Answer: Cannot be determined**<eos>
Define Owl as J; so J = 855. Define Blue Jay as p; c = J = 855; so p = 658 + c = 658 + 855 = 1513. Define Crow as a; so a = p + J = 1513 + 855 = 2368. Define Eagle as i; f = a + J = 2368 + 855 = 3223; d = f + p = 3223 + 1513 = 4736; so i = 710 + d = 710 + 4736 = 5446. Define Penguin as q; C = i = 5446; so q = 494 + C = 494 + 5446 = 5940. Define Parrot as x; b = q + J = 5940 + 855 = 6795; so x = b + i = 6795 + 5446 = 12241. Define Hawk as g; so g = x = 12241. Define Sparrow as P; so P = g + p = 12241 + 1513 = 13754. Answer: 13754.
**arguments:**

- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of hawk and the number of blue jay.
- the number of penguin equals 494 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of blue jay equals 658 plus the number of owl.
- the number of parrot equals the sum of the number of penguin, the number of owl, and the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 710 plus the sum of the number of crow, the number of owl, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of hawk equals the number of parrot.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of owl.
- the number of owl equals 855.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of sparrow as:
number of sparrow = number of hawk + number of blue jay
- we do not have any information about the number of hawk, so we cannot calculate the number of sparrow directly.
- however, we can calculate the number of blue jay as:
number of blue jay = 658 + number of owl
- we know that the number of owl equals 855, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get:
number of blue jay = 658 + 855 = 1513
- therefore, the number of sparrow is:
number of sparrow = number of hawk + 1513
- we still do not have any information about the number of hawk, so we cannot calculate the number of sparrow.

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Elephant, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 700.
- The number of Bear equals 392 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 720 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger = Wolf + Elephant + Raccoon + Deer
- The number of Wolf = 720 + Deer
- The number of Elephant = Bear + Raccoon + Fox
- The number of Bear = 392 + Fox
- The number of Fox = Raccoon
- The number of Deer = Elephant + Raccoon + Bear
- Substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of Tiger, we get:
  Tiger = (720 + Deer) + (Bear + Raccoon + Fox) + 700 + (Elephant + Raccoon + Bear)
- Substituting the equation for the number of Elephant into the above equation, we get:
  Tiger = (720 + Deer) + (392 + Fox + Raccoon + Fox) + 700 + (392 + Fox + Raccoon + Bear)
- Simplifying the above equation, we get:
  Tiger = 1814 + 2Fox + Raccoon + Bear
- Since the number of Fox equals the number of Raccoon, we can substitute Raccoon for Fox in the above equation:
  Tiger = 1814 + 2R + Bear
- Since the number of Raccoon equals 700, we can substitute 700 for R in the above equation:
  Tiger = 1814 + 2(700) + Bear
- Simplifying the above equation, we get:
  Tiger = 3214 + Bear

**Answer: 3214 + Bear**<eos>
Define Raccoon as w; so w = 700. Define Fox as k; so k = w = 700. Define Bear as b; L = k = 700; so b = 392 + L = 392 + 700 = 1092. Define Elephant as j; p = b + w = 1092 + 700 = 1792; so j = p + k = 1792 + 700 = 2492. Define Deer as D; x = j + w = 2492 + 700 = 3192; so D = x + b = 3192 + 1092 = 4284. Define Wolf as S; Q = D = 4284; so S = 720 + Q = 720 + 4284 = 5004. Define Tiger as A; H = S + j = 5004 + 2492 = 7496; B = H + w = 7496 + 700 = 8196; so A = B + D = 8196 + 4284 = 12480. Answer: 12480.
**arguments:**

- the number of tiger equals the sum of the number of wolf, the number of elephant, the number of raccoon, and the number of deer.
- the number of raccoon equals 700.
- the number of bear equals 392 plus the number of fox.
- the number of wolf equals 720 plus the number of deer.
- the number of fox equals the number of raccoon.
- the number of elephant equals the sum of the number of bear, the number of raccoon, and the number of fox.
- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of elephant, the number of raccoon, and the number of bear.

**calculation:**

- the number of tiger = wolf + elephant + raccoon + deer
- the number of wolf = 720 + deer
- the number of elephant = bear + raccoon + fox
- the number of bear = 392 + fox
- the number of fox = raccoon
- the number of deer = elephant + raccoon + bear
- substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of tiger, we get:
  tiger = (720 + deer) + (bear + raccoon + fox) + 700 + (elephant + raccoon + bear)
- substituting the equation for the number of elephant into the above equation, we get:
  tiger = (720 + deer) + (392 + fox + raccoon + fox) + 700 + (392 + fox + raccoon + bear)
- simplifying the above equation, we get:
  tiger = 1814 + 2fox + raccoon + bear
- since the number of fox equals the number of raccoon, we can substitute raccoon for fox in the above equation:
  tiger = 1814 + 2r + bear
- since the number of raccoon equals 700, we can substitute 700 for r in the above equation:
  tiger = 1814 + 2(700) + bear
- simplifying the above equation, we get:
  tiger = 3214 + bear

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 193 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Crow, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Sparrow equals 865 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals 519 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 226 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Hawk equals 546 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Crow equals 728 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Owl equals 537 plus the number of Crow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot = 193 + (Blue Jay + Crow + Owl)
- The number of Sparrow = 865 + (Parrot + Blue Jay)
- The number of Eagle = 519 + (Sparrow + Crow)
- The number of Blue Jay = 226 + Owl
- The number of Hawk = 546 + Blue Jay
- The number of Crow = 728 + Hawk
- The number of Owl = 537 + Crow

Substituting the number of Blue Jay, Crow, and Owl from the previous equations into the equations above, we get:

- The number of Parrot = 193 + (226 + 537 + Owl) = 956 + Owl
- The number of Sparrow = 865 + (956 + Owl) = 1821 + Owl
- The number of Eagle = 519 + (1821 + Owl + 728) = 2658 + Owl

Therefore, the number of Eagle is 2658 + Owl.

**Answer: 2658 + Owl**<eos>
Define Crow as N; F = None = 546; so N = 728 + F = 728 + 546 = 1274. Define Owl as P; m = N = 1274; so P = 537 + m = 537 + 1274 = 1811. Define Blue Jay as r; z = P = 1811; so r = 226 + z = 226 + 1811 = 2037. Define Parrot as M; K = r + N = 2037 + 1274 = 3311; J = K + P = 3311 + 1811 = 5122; so M = 193 + J = 193 + 5122 = 5315. Define Sparrow as o; L = M + r = 5315 + 2037 = 7352; so o = 865 + L = 865 + 7352 = 8217. Define Eagle as g; U = o + N = 8217 + 1274 = 9491; so g = 519 + U = 519 + 9491 = 10010. Answer: 10010.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 193 plus the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of crow, and the number of owl.
- the number of sparrow equals 865 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of blue jay.
- the number of eagle equals 519 plus the sum of the number of sparrow and the number of crow.
- the number of blue jay equals 226 plus the number of owl.
- the number of hawk equals 546 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of crow equals 728 plus the number of hawk.
- the number of owl equals 537 plus the number of crow.

**calculation:**

- the number of parrot = 193 + (blue jay + crow + owl)
- the number of sparrow = 865 + (parrot + blue jay)
- the number of eagle = 519 + (sparrow + crow)
- the number of blue jay = 226 + owl
- the number of hawk = 546 + blue jay
- the number of crow = 728 + hawk
- the number of owl = 537 + crow

substituting the number of blue jay, crow, and owl from the previous equations into the equations above, we get:

- the number of parrot = 193 + (226 + 537 + owl) = 956 + owl
- the number of sparrow = 865 + (956 + owl) = 1821 + owl
- the number of eagle = 519 + (1821 + owl + 728) = 2658 + owl

therefore, the number of eagle is 2658 + owl.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 128 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Blue Jay, the number of Eagle, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Hawk equals 552 plus the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Sparrow equals 45 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 197.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Crow equals the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Eagle = the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Blue Jay
= the number of Crow + the number of Blue Jay
= 197 + 197
= 394

- The number of Owl = the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Blue Jay, the number of Eagle, and the number of Crow
= 45 + 197 + 394 + 197
= 735

- The number of Hawk = 552 + the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, and the number of Blue Jay
= 552 + 735 + 394
= 1681

**Answer: 1681**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as h; so h = 197. Define Crow as e; so e = h = 197. Define Eagle as K; so K = e + h = 197 + 197 = 394. Define Parrot as J; y = K = 394; so J = 128 + y = 128 + 394 = 522. Define Sparrow as I; x = J = 522; so I = 45 + x = 45 + 522 = 567. Define Owl as U; s = I + h = 567 + 197 = 764; G = s + K = 764 + 394 = 1158; so U = G + e = 1158 + 197 = 1355. Define Hawk as Y; W = U + K = 1355 + 394 = 1749; t = W + h = 1749 + 197 = 1946; so Y = 552 + t = 552 + 1946 = 2498. Answer: 2498.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Fox, and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 827 plus the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals 740 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 911 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Fox equals 323.
- The number of Wolf equals 590 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger = 323 + (827 + 740 + 590) = 2357
- The number of Raccoon = 911 + 2357 + 323 = 3991

**Answer: 3991**<eos>
Define Fox as n; so n = 323. Define Wolf as N; K = n = 323; so N = 590 + K = 590 + 323 = 913. Define Elephant as r; e = N = 913; so r = 740 + e = 740 + 913 = 1653. Define Deer as l; A = r + n = 1653 + 323 = 1976; X = A + N = 1976 + 913 = 2889; so l = 827 + X = 827 + 2889 = 3716. Define Tiger as o; so o = l + n = 3716 + 323 = 4039. Define Bear as W; R = o = 4039; so W = 911 + R = 911 + 4039 = 4950. Define Raccoon as J; Q = W + n = 4950 + 323 = 5273; so J = Q + o = 5273 + 4039 = 9312. Answer: 9312.

**Answer: 1904**<eos>
Define Tiger as D; so D = 449. Define Wolf as J; y = D = 449; so J = 299 + y = 299 + 449 = 748. Define Fox as x; T = J + D = 748 + 449 = 1197; so x = 142 + T = 142 + 1197 = 1339. Define Raccoon as u; L = x + D = 1339 + 449 = 1788; so u = L + J = 1788 + 748 = 2536. Define Bear as r; E = u = 2536; so r = 602 + E = 602 + 2536 = 3138. Define Deer as i; N = r + D = 3138 + 449 = 3587; so i = 456 + N = 456 + 3587 = 4043. Define Elephant as M; q = i = 4043; so M = 397 + q = 397 + 4043 = 4440. Answer: 4440.
**arguments:**

- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of fox, the number of tiger, and the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 299 plus the number of tiger.
- the number of fox equals 142 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of tiger.
- the number of elephant equals 397 plus the number of deer.
- the number of tiger equals 449.
- the number of deer equals 456 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of tiger.
- the number of bear equals 602 plus the number of raccoon.

**calculation:**

- the number of raccoon = fox + tiger + wolf = 142 + 449 + 299 = 880.
- the number of deer = 456 + bear + tiger = 456 + (602 + raccoon) + 449 = 1507.
- the number of elephant = 397 + deer = 397 + 1507 = 1904.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated. Problem: The number of Bear equals 267 plus the number of Fox.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 267 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 185 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 458.
- The number of Raccoon equals 245 plus the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals 617 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 495 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Fox, and the number of Bear.

**Calculations:**

- The number of Bear = 267 + 458 = 725.
- The number of Wolf = 185 + 725 = 910.
- The sum of the number of Elephant, Fox, and Wolf = 725 + 458 + 910 = 2193.
- The number of Raccoon = 245 + 2193 = 2438.

**Answer: 2438**<eos>
Define Fox as f; so f = 458. Define Bear as b; I = f = 458; so b = 267 + I = 267 + 458 = 725. Define Wolf as U; S = b = 725; so U = 185 + S = 185 + 725 = 910. Define Deer as Y; T = U + f = 910 + 458 = 1368; p = T + b = 1368 + 725 = 2093; so Y = 495 + p = 495 + 2093 = 2588. Define Elephant as u; L = Y = 2588; so u = 617 + L = 617 + 2588 = 3205. Define Raccoon as m; t = u + f = 3205 + 458 = 3663; w = t + U = 3663 + 910 = 4573; so m = 245 + w = 245 + 4573 = 4818. Answer: 4818.

- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Eagle equals 145 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Crow equals the number of Eagle, which is not explicitly given in the text. Therefore, we cannot calculate the number of Crow from the provided information.

**Answer: Cannot be determined from the provided information.**<eos>
Define Hawk as i; so i = 9. Define Penguin as h; C = i = 9; so h = 232 + C = 232 + 9 = 241. Define Owl as s; so s = h + i = 241 + 9 = 250. Define Parrot as Q; o = s + i = 250 + 9 = 259; w = o + h = 259 + 241 = 500; so Q = 863 + w = 863 + 500 = 1363. Define Sparrow as d; r = Q + s = 1363 + 250 = 1613; so d = 3 + r = 3 + 1613 = 1616. Define Blue Jay as H; so H = d + Q = 1616 + 1363 = 2979. Define Eagle as a; l = H = 2979; so a = 145 + l = 145 + 2979 = 3124. Define Crow as Y; so Y = a = 3124. Answer: 3124.

- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 129 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Parrot, the number of Eagle, and the number of Crow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Sparrow = Crow + Parrot = 80 + 115 = 195.
- The number of Blue Jay = Hawk + Parrot + Eagle + Crow = 550 + 115 + 631 + 80 = 1516.

**Answer: 1516**<eos>
Define Parrot as u; so u = 115. Define Crow as d; O = u = 115; so d = 80 + O = 80 + 115 = 195. Define Sparrow as k; so k = d + u = 195 + 115 = 310. Define Eagle as X; E = k + d = 310 + 195 = 505; so X = 631 + E = 631 + 505 = 1136. Define Owl as G; i = X = 1136; so G = 129 + i = 129 + 1136 = 1265. Define Hawk as e; F = G + u = 1265 + 115 = 1380; so e = 550 + F = 550 + 1380 = 1930. Define Blue Jay as I; v = e + u = 1930 + 115 = 2045; C = v + X = 2045 + 1136 = 3181; so I = C + d = 3181 + 195 = 3376. Answer: 3376.

- The number of Fox equals 23.
- The number of Bear equals 114 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Wolf, and the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Elephant = 243 + 23 = 266.
- The number of Wolf = 25 + 266 = 291.
- The number of Deer = 355 - 291 = 64.
- The number of Bear = 114 + 64 + 291 = 369.
- The number of Raccoon = 369 + 266 + 23 = 658.

**Answer: 658**<eos>
Define Fox as w; so w = 23. Define Elephant as e; x = w = 23; so e = 243 + x = 243 + 23 = 266. Define Wolf as j; p = e = 266; so j = 25 + p = 25 + 266 = 291. Define Deer as S; a = j + w = 291 + 23 = 314; V = a + e = 314 + 266 = 580; so S = 355 + V = 355 + 580 = 935. Define Bear as L; H = S + j = 935 + 291 = 1226; B = H + e = 1226 + 266 = 1492; so L = 114 + B = 114 + 1492 = 1606. Define Raccoon as F; t = L + e = 1606 + 266 = 1872; so F = t + w = 1872 + 23 = 1895.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 216 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals 568 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Tiger equals 968.
- The number of Deer equals 251 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Tiger, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals 878 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Wolf equals 988 plus the number of Raccoon.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear equals 216 + (251 + 568 + 968) = 216 + 1787 = 1903.
- The number of Raccoon equals the number of Elephant = 878.
- The number of Wolf equals 988 + 878 = 1866.
- The number of Deer equals 251 + (568 + 968 + 878) = 251 + 2423 = 2674.

**Answer: 1903**<eos>
Define Tiger as J; so J = 968. Define Elephant as Z; c = J = 968; so Z = 878 + c = 878 + 968 = 1846. Define Raccoon as R; so R = Z = 1846. Define Wolf as y; W = R = 1846; so y = 988 + W = 988 + 1846 = 2834. Define Fox as H; K = y + J = 2834 + 968 = 3802; so H = 568 + K = 568 + 3802 = 4370. Define Deer as f; b = H + J = 4370 + 968 = 5338; F = b + Z = 5338 + 1846 = 7184; so f = 251 + F = 251 + 7184 = 7435. Define Bear as w; s = f + y = 7435 + 2834 = 10269; so w = 216 + s = 216 + 10269 = 10485. Answer: 10485.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 216 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf.
- the number of raccoon equals the number of elephant.
- the number of fox equals 568 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of tiger.
- the number of tiger equals 968.
- the number of deer equals 251 plus the sum of the number of fox, the number of tiger, and the number of elephant.
- the number of elephant equals 878 plus the number of tiger.
- the number of wolf equals 988 plus the number of raccoon.

**calculation:**

- the number of bear equals 216 + (251 + 568 + 968) = 216 + 1787 = 1903.
- the number of raccoon equals the number of elephant = 878.
- the number of wolf equals 988 + 878 = 1866.
- the number of deer equals 251 + (568 + 968 + 878) = 251 + 2423 = 2674.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals 320 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Lion.
- The number of Bear equals the number of Tiger.
- The number of Lion equals 89.
- The number of Deer equals 895 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Wolf equals 196 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Elephant equals 634 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Raccoon equals 557 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Lion.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger = 320 + Fox + Lion = 320 + Raccoon + Lion (because Fox equals Raccoon)
- The number of Bear = Tiger = 320 + Raccoon + Lion
- The number of Lion = 89
- The number of Deer = 895 + Wolf
- The number of Fox = Raccoon = 557
- The number of Wolf = 196 + Lion
- The number of Elephant = 634 + Bear

Substituting the value of Lion into the equation for Wolf:
- The number of Wolf = 196 + 89 = 285

Substituting the value of Raccoon into the equation for Tiger:
- The number of Tiger = 320 + 557 + 89 = 966

Substituting the value of Bear into the equation for Elephant:
- The number of Elephant = 634 + 966 = 1500

**Answer: 1500**<eos>
Define Lion as z; so z = 89. Define Wolf as r; k = z = 89; so r = 196 + k = 196 + 89 = 285. Define Deer as m; f = r = 285; so m = 895 + f = 895 + 285 = 1180. Define Raccoon as s; L = m + z = 1180 + 89 = 1269; so s = 557 + L = 557 + 1269 = 1826. Define Fox as p; so p = s = 1826. Define Tiger as M; S = p + z = 1826 + 89 = 1915; so M = 320 + S = 320 + 1915 = 2235. Define Bear as O; so O = M = 2235. Define Elephant as a; B = O = 2235; so a = 634 + B = 634 + 2235 = 2869. Answer: 2869.
**arguments:**

- the number of tiger equals 320 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of lion.
- the number of bear equals the number of tiger.
- the number of lion equals 89.
- the number of deer equals 895 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of fox equals the number of raccoon.
- the number of wolf equals 196 plus the number of lion.
- the number of elephant equals 634 plus the number of bear.
- the number of raccoon equals 557 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of lion.

**calculation:**

- the number of tiger = 320 + fox + lion = 320 + raccoon + lion (because fox equals raccoon)
- the number of bear = tiger = 320 + raccoon + lion
- the number of lion = 89
- the number of deer = 895 + wolf
- the number of fox = raccoon = 557
- the number of wolf = 196 + lion
- the number of elephant = 634 + bear

substituting the value of lion into the equation for wolf:
- the number of wolf = 196 + 89 = 285

substituting the value of raccoon into the equation for tiger:
- the number of tiger = 320 + 557 + 89 = 966

substituting the value of bear into the equation for elephant:
- the number of elephant = 634 + 966 = 1500

**Arguments:**

- The number of Penguin equals 215 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 920 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Crow.
- The number of Eagle equals 481 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 703 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Crow, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 11.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Sparrow:
Number of Sparrow = Number of Eagle + Number of Crow
= (481 + Number of Crow) + Number of Crow
= 481 + 2 * Number of Crow

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Crow:
Number of Crow = Number of Crow + Number of Parrot
= Number of Crow + 11

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Hawk:
Number of Hawk = Number of Blue Jay + Number of Crow + Number of Eagle
= (Number of Penguin + Number of Crow) + Number of Crow + (481 + Number of Crow)
= 215 + 2 * Number of Crow + Number of Crow + 481 + Number of Crow
= 797 + 4 * Number of Crow

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl:
Number of Owl = 703 + Number of Hawk
= 703 + (797 + 4 * Number of Crow)
= 1490 + 4 * Number of Crow

**Answer: 1490 + 4 * Number of Crow**<eos>
Define Parrot as v; so v = 11. Define Crow as t; L = v = 11; so t = 920 + L = 920 + 11 = 931. Define Eagle as U; c = t + v = 931 + 11 = 942; so U = 481 + c = 481 + 942 = 1423. Define Sparrow as f; so f = U + t = 1423 + 931 = 2354. Define Penguin as H; q = f + v = 2354 + 11 = 2365; so H = 215 + q = 215 + 2365 = 2580. Define Blue Jay as K; so K = H + t = 2580 + 931 = 3511. Define Hawk as Y; Z = K + t = 3511 + 931 = 4442; so Y = Z + U = 4442 + 1423 = 5865. Define Owl as d; D = Y = 5865; so d = 703 + D = 703 + 5865 = 6568. Answer: 6568.
**arguments:**

- the number of penguin equals 215 plus the sum of the number of sparrow and the number of parrot.
- the number of crow equals 920 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of eagle and the number of crow.
- the number of eagle equals 481 plus the sum of the number of crow and the number of parrot.

- the number of hawk equals the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of crow, and the number of eagle.
- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of penguin and the number of crow.
- the number of parrot equals 11.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of sparrow:
number of sparrow = number of eagle + number of crow
= (481 + number of crow) + number of crow
= 481 + 2 * number of crow

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of crow:
number of crow = number of crow + number of parrot
= number of crow + 11

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of hawk:
number of hawk = number of blue jay + number of crow + number of eagle
= (number of penguin + number of crow) + number of crow + (481 + number of crow)
= 215 + 2 * number of crow + number of crow + 481 + number of crow
= 797 + 4 * number of crow

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of owl:
number of owl = 703 + number of hawk
= 703 + (797 + 4 * number of crow)
= 1490 + 4 * number of crow

- The number of Owl equals 294 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals 612.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Crow = Hawk + Blue Jay + Owl = Hawk + 433 + 294 = Hawk + 727.
- The number of Sparrow = Eagle + Crow + Blue Jay + Hawk = (Crow + Parrot + Owl) + Crow + 433 + Hawk = (Hawk + 727) + Hawk + 433 + Hawk = 3 * Hawk + 1160.

**Answer: 3 * Hawk + 1160**<eos>
Define Parrot as z; so z = 612. Define Blue Jay as c; Y = z = 612; so c = 433 + Y = 433 + 612 = 1045. Define Owl as F; h = c = 1045; so F = 294 + h = 294 + 1045 = 1339. Define Hawk as J; so J = F = 1339. Define Crow as E; U = J + c = 1339 + 1045 = 2384; so E = U + F = 2384 + 1339 = 3723. Define Eagle as k; K = E + z = 3723 + 612 = 4335; so k = K + F = 4335 + 1339 = 5674. Define Sparrow as o; l = k + E = 5674 + 3723 = 9397; X = l + c = 9397 + 1045 = 10442; so o = X + J = 10442 + 1339 = 11781. Answer: 11781.

- The number of Bear = Lion + Tiger.

**Answer:**

**Answer: 425 + Lion + Tiger**<eos>
Define Tiger as V; so V = 908. Define Lion as b; B = V = 908; so b = 501 + B = 501 + 908 = 1409. Define Bear as t; so t = b + V = 1409 + 908 = 2317. Define Fox as k; e = t = 2317; so k = 851 + e = 851 + 2317 = 3168. Define Raccoon as m; q = k + V = 3168 + 908 = 4076; so m = 417 + q = 417 + 4076 = 4493. Define Wolf as W; so W = m = 4493. Define Elephant as v; i = W + V = 4493 + 908 = 5401; so v = 86 + i = 86 + 5401 = 5487. Define Deer as Z; U = v + t = 5487 + 2317 = 7804; so Z = 339 + U = 339 + 7804 = 8143. Answer: 8143.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Hawk equals 189 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot equals 112 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 814 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Crow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 746.
- The number of Penguin equals 973.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Crow as:
Crow = Hawk + Eagle + Sparrow + Blue Jay
Crow = 189 + (Eagle + Sparrow + Blue Jay) + 746 + 814 + Sparrow
Crow = 189 + Eagle + 2 * Sparrow + 814 + Sparrow
Crow = 1003 + Eagle + 3 * Sparrow

- We also know that the number of Owl equals the number of Crow, so:
Owl = Crow
Owl = 1003 + Eagle + 3 * Sparrow

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle as:
Eagle = Blue Jay + Sparrow
Eagle = 814 + Sparrow

- Substituting the value of Eagle into the equation for Crow, we get:
Crow = 1003 + (814 + Sparrow) + 3 * Sparrow
Crow = 1817 + 4 * Sparrow

- Therefore, the number of Parrot is:
Parrot = 112 + Owl
Parrot = 112 + (1003 + 4 * Sparrow)
Parrot = 112 + 1003 + 4 * Sparrow
Parrot = 1115 + 4 * Sparrow

**Answer: 1115 + 4 * Sparrow**<eos>
Define Sparrow as Z; so Z = 746. Define Blue Jay as u; P = Z = 746; so u = 814 + P = 814 + 746 = 1560. Define Eagle as r; so r = u + Z = 1560 + 746 = 2306. Define Hawk as V; z = r + Z = 2306 + 746 = 3052; t = z + u = 3052 + 1560 = 4612; so V = 189 + t = 189 + 4612 = 4801. Define Crow as T; c = V + r = 4801 + 2306 = 7107; j = c + Z = 7107 + 746 = 7853; so T = j + u = 7853 + 1560 = 9413. Define Owl as p; so p = T = 9413. Define Parrot as n; w = p = 9413; so n = 112 + w = 112 + 9413 = 9525. Answer: 9525.

crow = hawk + eagle + sparrow + blue jay
crow = 189 + (eagle + sparrow + blue jay) + 746 + 814 + sparrow
crow = 189 + eagle + 2 * sparrow + 814 + sparrow
crow = 1003 + eagle + 3 * sparrow

- we also know that the number of owl equals the number of crow, so:
owl = crow
owl = 1003 + eagle + 3 * sparrow

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of eagle as:
eagle = blue jay + sparrow
eagle = 814 + sparrow

- substituting the value of eagle into the equation for crow, we get:
crow = 1003 + (814 + sparrow) + 3 * sparrow
crow = 1817 + 4 * sparrow

- therefore, the number of parrot is:
parrot = 112 + owl
parrot = 112 + (1003 + 4 * sparrow)
parrot = 112 + 1003 + 4 * sparrow
parrot = 1115 + 4 * sparrow

**answer: 1115 + 4 * sparrow**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 121 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 84 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Parrot, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 82.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Owl, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 509 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Parrot, and the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the number of Crow:**
Number of Crow = 121 + Number of Sparrow
Number of Crow = 121 + 84
Number of Crow = 205

2. **Calculate the number of Sparrow:**
Number of Sparrow = 84 + Number of Parrot
Number of Sparrow = 84 + 82
Number of Sparrow = 166

3. **Calculate the number of Eagle:**
Number of Eagle = Number of Owl + Number of Parrot + Number of Sparrow + Number of Crow
Number of Eagle = 509 + 82 + 166 + 205
Number of Eagle = 1,762

4. **Calculate the number of Blue Jay:**
Number of Blue Jay = Number of Eagle + Number of Owl + Number of Parrot
Number of Blue Jay = 1,762 + 509 + 82
Number of Blue Jay = 2,353

**Answer: 2,353**<eos>
Define Parrot as k; so k = 82. Define Sparrow as g; b = k = 82; so g = 84 + b = 84 + 82 = 166. Define Crow as X; C = g = 166; so X = 121 + C = 121 + 166 = 287. Define Owl as D; z = X + k = 287 + 82 = 369; w = z + g = 369 + 166 = 535; so D = 509 + w = 509 + 535 = 1044. Define Eagle as N; t = D + k = 1044 + 82 = 1126; F = t + g = 1126 + 166 = 1292; so N = F + X = 1292 + 287 = 1579. Define Blue Jay as M; J = N + D = 1579 + 1044 = 2623; so M = J + k = 2623 + 82 = 2705. Answer: 2705.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot is 358.
- The number of Hawk is 62 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle is the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow is the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Owl, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow is the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl is 883 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay is 135 plus the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Hawk is 62 + (Owl + Blue Jay) = 62 + (883 + 135) = 62 + 1018 = 1080.
- The number of Blue Jay is 135 + Sparrow = 135 + 358 = 493.
- The number of Sparrow is 358.
- The number of Owl is 883 + Eagle = 883 + (Eagle) = 883 + (1080 - 135) = 883 + 945 = 1828.
- The number of Crow is Hawk + Owl + Blue Jay + Sparrow = 1080 + 1828 + 493 + 358 = 3759.

**Answer: 3759**<eos>
Define Parrot as V; so V = 358. Define Sparrow as w; so w = V = 358. Define Blue Jay as t; F = w = 358; so t = 135 + F = 135 + 358 = 493. Define Eagle as h; E = t + w = 493 + 358 = 851; so h = E + V = 851 + 358 = 1209. Define Owl as M; A = h = 1209; so M = 883 + A = 883 + 1209 = 2092. Define Hawk as c; W = M + t = 2092 + 493 = 2585; so c = 62 + W = 62 + 2585 = 2647. Define Crow as C; s = c + M = 2647 + 2092 = 4739; d = s + t = 4739 + 493 = 5232; so C = d + w = 5232 + 358 = 5590.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 82 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Bear equals 91 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 607 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Tiger equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Elephant equals 693 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Wolf, the number of Elephant, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 581.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Fox equals 82 plus the number of Elephant. Therefore, the number of Elephant equals the number of Fox - 82.
- The number of Bear equals 91 plus the number of Wolf. Therefore, the number of Bear equals 91 + 581 = 672.
- The number of Tiger equals the number of Fox. Therefore, the number of Tiger equals 82.
- The number of Elephant equals 693 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Wolf. Therefore, the number of Elephant equals 693 + 672 = 1365.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Wolf, the number of Elephant, and the number of Bear. Therefore, the number of Raccoon equals 607 + 581 + 1365 + 672 = 3225.

**Answer: 3225**<eos>
Define Wolf as u; so u = 581. Define Bear as I; R = u = 581; so I = 91 + R = 91 + 581 = 672. Define Elephant as D; q = I + u = 672 + 581 = 1253; so D = 693 + q = 693 + 1253 = 1946. Define Fox as J; P = D = 1946; so J = 82 + P = 82 + 1946 = 2028. Define Tiger as s; so s = J = 2028. Define Deer as e; y = s = 2028; so e = 607 + y = 607 + 2028 = 2635. Define Raccoon as l; Q = e + u = 2635 + 581 = 3216; S = Q + D = 3216 + 1946 = 5162; so l = S + I = 5162 + 672 = 5834. Answer: 5834.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Hawk.
- The number of Crow equals 387 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Owl, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot equals 28 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Penguin equals 565 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Sparrow equals 286.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can deduce that:
    - The number of Blue Jay = the number of Hawk.
    - The number of Crow = 387 + the number of Eagle.
    - The number of Eagle = the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Owl, and the number of Sparrow.
    - The number of Parrot = 28 + the number of Owl.
    - The number of Penguin = 565 + the number of Blue Jay.
    - The number of Sparrow = 286.
    - The number of Owl = the number of Sparrow.
    - The number of Hawk = the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Eagle.

- We can substitute the equations above to get:
    - The number of Blue Jay = the number of Hawk = x.
    - The number of Crow = 387 + x.
    - The number of Eagle = x + 28 + the number of Owl.
    - The number of Parrot = 28 + the number of Owl.
    - The number of Penguin = 565 + x.
    - The number of Sparrow = 286.
    - The number of Owl = 286.
    - The number of Hawk = 387 + x + 286.

- We can solve for x:
    - x + x = 286 (because the number of Blue Jay equals the number of Hawk)
    - 2x = 286
    - x = 143

- Therefore, the number of Penguin is:
    - The number of Penguin = 565 + x = 565 + 143 = 708

**Answer: 708**<eos>
Define Sparrow as y; so y = 286. Define Owl as A; so A = y = 286. Define Parrot as N; D = A = 286; so N = 28 + D = 28 + 286 = 314. Define Eagle as P; R = N + A = 314 + 286 = 600; so P = R + y = 600 + 286 = 886. Define Crow as u; F = P = 886; so u = 387 + F = 387 + 886 = 1273. Define Hawk as n; W = u + y = 1273 + 286 = 1559; so n = W + P = 1559 + 886 = 2445. Define Blue Jay as m; so m = n = 2445. Define Penguin as C; h = m = 2445; so C = 565 + h = 565 + 2445 = 3010. Answer: 3010.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Owl.
- The number of Penguin equals 631 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 263 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 223 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Hawk.
- The number of Crow equals 380 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Crow.
- The number of Hawk equals 550.
- The number of Peacock equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Owl, the number of Parrot, and the number of Crow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot = Crow + Owl = 380 + 550 = 930.
- The number of Penguin = 631 + 930 = 1561.
- The number of Blue Jay = 263 + Eagle = 263 + 223 = 486.
- The number of Eagle = 223 + Sparrow = 223 + 0 = 223.
- The number of Owl = Hawk = 550.
- The number of Crow = 380 + Owl + Hawk = 380 + 550 + 550 = 1480.
- The number of Sparrow = Parrot + Crow = 930 + 1480 = 2410.
- The number of Peacock = Blue Jay + Owl + Parrot + Crow = 486 + 550 + 930 + 1480 = 3446.

**Answer: 3446**<eos>
Define Hawk as Z; so Z = 550. Define Owl as b; so b = Z = 550. Define Crow as T; f = b + Z = 550 + 550 = 1100; so T = 380 + f = 380 + 1100 = 1480. Define Parrot as B; so B = T + b = 1480 + 550 = 2030. Define Sparrow as e; so e = B + T = 2030 + 1480 = 3510. Define Eagle as D; y = e = 3510; so D = 223 + y = 223 + 3510 = 3733. Define Blue Jay as r; F = D = 3733; so r = 263 + F = 263 + 3733 = 3996. Define Peacock as X; U = r + b = 3996 + 550 = 4546; t = U + B = 4546 + 2030 = 6576; so X = t + T = 6576 + 1480 = 8056.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 597 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk equals 818 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 398.
- The number of Sparrow equals 85 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Sparrow, the number of Owl, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 107 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the number of Eagle:**
   - Eagle = Owl + Blue Jay
   - Eagle = 597 + Sparrow

2. **Calculate the number of Sparrow:**
   - Sparrow = 85 + Parrot + Blue Jay
   - Sparrow = 85 + (107 + Blue Jay) + Blue Jay
   - Sparrow = 85 + 107 + 2 * Blue Jay

3. **Calculate the number of Hawk:**
   - Hawk = 818 + Eagle
   - Hawk = 818 + (Owl + Blue Jay)

4. **Calculate the number of Owl:**
   - Owl = 597 + Sparrow

5. **Calculate the number of Parrot:**
   - Parrot = 107 + Blue Jay

6. **Calculate the number of Crow:**
   - Crow = Hawk + Sparrow + Owl + Parrot
   - Crow = (818 + (Owl + Blue Jay)) + (85 + 107 + 2 * Blue Jay) + 597 + (107 + Blue Jay)
   - Crow = 2720 + 3 * Blue Jay

**Answer: 2720 + 3 * Blue Jay**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as w; so w = 398. Define Parrot as H; x = w = 398; so H = 107 + x = 107 + 398 = 505. Define Sparrow as L; D = H + w = 505 + 398 = 903; so L = 85 + D = 85 + 903 = 988. Define Owl as q; O = L = 988; so q = 597 + O = 597 + 988 = 1585. Define Eagle as d; so d = q + w = 1585 + 398 = 1983. Define Hawk as Z; T = d = 1983; so Z = 818 + T = 818 + 1983 = 2801. Define Crow as p; r = Z + L = 2801 + 988 = 3789; v = r + q = 3789 + 1585 = 5374; so p = v + H = 5374 + 505 = 5879. Answer: 5879.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 231 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Tiger, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Tiger equals 636 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Wolf equals 135.
- The number of Bear equals 833 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Deer equals 726 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 236 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger is 636 plus the number of Raccoon, so the number of Raccoon is 636 - Tiger.
- The number of Elephant is 231 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Tiger, so the number of Deer is (231 - Elephant) - Raccoon - Tiger.
- The number of Fox is the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Tiger, and the number of Elephant, so the number of Bear is Fox - Tiger - Elephant.

**Answer:**

**Answer: Fox = 135 + Bear + Elephant**<eos>
Define Raccoon as O; m = None = 135; so O = 236 + m = 236 + 135 = 371. Define Tiger as D; v = O = 371; so D = 636 + v = 636 + 371 = 1007. Define Deer as H; T = D + O = 1007 + 371 = 1378; so H = 726 + T = 726 + 1378 = 2104. Define Elephant as q; W = H + O = 2104 + 371 = 2475; i = W + D = 2475 + 1007 = 3482; so q = 231 + i = 231 + 3482 = 3713. Define Bear as Q; X = q = 3713; so Q = 833 + X = 833 + 3713 = 4546. Define Fox as F; A = Q + D = 4546 + 1007 = 5553; so F = A + q = 5553 + 3713 = 9266. Answer: 9266.

- The number of Parrot = Blue Jay + Sparrow + Owl
= 3133 + 706 + 391
= 4220

**Answer: 4220**<eos>
Define Sparrow as r; so r = 706. Define Crow as Q; u = r = 706; so Q = 933 + u = 933 + 706 = 1639. Define Owl as D; A = Q + r = 1639 + 706 = 2345; so D = 391 + A = 391 + 2345 = 2736. Define Hawk as I; O = D + r = 2736 + 706 = 3442; R = O + Q = 3442 + 1639 = 5081; so I = 622 + R = 622 + 5081 = 5703. Define Peacock as X; so X = I = 5703. Define Blue Jay as L; s = X = 5703; so L = 481 + s = 481 + 5703 = 6184. Define Parrot as q; Z = L + r = 6184 + 706 = 6890; so q = Z + D = 6890 + 2736 = 9626. Answer: 9626.

- The number of Deer = 666 + Bear = 666 + 3695 = 4361.

**Answer: 4361**<eos>
Define Wolf as b; so b = 872. Define Elephant as t; A = b = 872; so t = 868 + A = 868 + 872 = 1740. Define Raccoon as S; D = t = 1740; so S = 356 + D = 356 + 1740 = 2096. Define Fox as Z; z = S + b = 2096 + 872 = 2968; J = z + t = 2968 + 1740 = 4708; so Z = 627 + J = 627 + 4708 = 5335. Define Bear as c; m = Z + S = 5335 + 2096 = 7431; L = m + b = 7431 + 872 = 8303; so c = L + t = 8303 + 1740 = 10043. Define Deer as w; F = c = 10043; so w = 666 + F = 666 + 10043 = 10709.

- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Eagle, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 385 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 551 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Sparrow equals 425.
- The number of Eagle equals 953 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk equals 73 plus the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot = Blue Jay + Eagle + Crow
= 385 + 953 + 551
= 1889

**Answer: 1889**<eos>
Define Sparrow as Q; so Q = 425. Define Eagle as h; u = Q = 425; so h = 953 + u = 953 + 425 = 1378. Define Owl as N; so N = h = 1378. Define Hawk as a; K = N + Q = 1378 + 425 = 1803; i = K + h = 1803 + 1378 = 3181; so a = 73 + i = 73 + 3181 = 3254. Define Crow as M; Z = a + h = 3254 + 1378 = 4632; so M = 551 + Z = 551 + 4632 = 5183. Define Blue Jay as X; s = M = 5183; so X = 385 + s = 385 + 5183 = 5568. Define Parrot as J; y = X + h = 5568 + 1378 = 6946; so J = y + M = 6946 + 5183 = 12129. Answer: 12129.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals 374 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Bear, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 595.
- The number of Fox equals 319 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 285 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 633 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Wolf equals 554 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Deer, and the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon is 374 + (number of Wolf) + (number of Bear) + (number of Deer) = 374 + x + y + 595.
- The number of Fox is 319 + (number of Bear) + (number of Deer) = 319 + y + 595.
- The number of Bear is 285 + (number of Deer) = 285 + 595.
- The number of Elephant is 633 + 374 + x + y = 1007 + x + y.

**Answer:** Answer: 1007 + x + y<eos>
Define Deer as m; so m = 595. Define Bear as N; c = m = 595; so N = 285 + c = 285 + 595 = 880. Define Fox as k; C = N + m = 880 + 595 = 1475; so k = 319 + C = 319 + 1475 = 1794. Define Wolf as G; X = k + m = 1794 + 595 = 2389; Y = X + N = 2389 + 880 = 3269; so G = 554 + Y = 554 + 3269 = 3823. Define Raccoon as K; H = G + N = 3823 + 880 = 4703; e = H + m = 4703 + 595 = 5298; so K = 374 + e = 374 + 5298 = 5672. Define Elephant as i; L = K = 5672; so i = 633 + L = 633 + 5672 = 6305. Answer: 6305.

- The number of Deer equals 344 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 670 plus the number of Tiger.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear is 812 + (Elephant + Tiger) = 812 + (x + 702) = 1514 + x.
- The number of Raccoon is 89 + Bear = 89 + (1514 + x) = 1603 + x.
- The number of Fox is 46 + (Wolf + Deer + Bear) = 46 + (y + 344 + (1514 + x)) = 1964 + x + y.

**Answer: 1964 + x + y**<eos>
Define Tiger as h; so h = 702. Define Elephant as F; u = h = 702; so F = 670 + u = 670 + 702 = 1372. Define Bear as Z; k = F + h = 1372 + 702 = 2074; so Z = 812 + k = 812 + 2074 = 2886. Define Raccoon as N; z = Z = 2886; so N = 89 + z = 89 + 2886 = 2975. Define Deer as O; b = N = 2975; so O = 344 + b = 344 + 2975 = 3319. Define Wolf as s; so s = O = 3319. Define Fox as H; e = s + O = 3319 + 3319 = 6638; B = e + Z = 6638 + 2886 = 9524; so H = 46 + B = 46 + 9524 = 9570. Answer: 9570.

- The number of Blue Jay equals 691.
- The number of Penguin equals 426 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Sparrow = 361 + 691 = 1052.
- The number of Crow = 537 + (426 + 691 + x), where x is the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot = 676 + 1052 = 1728.

**Answer: 1728**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as a; so a = 691. Define Sparrow as X; U = a = 691; so X = 361 + U = 361 + 691 = 1052. Define Hawk as C; so C = X = 1052. Define Eagle as b; so b = C + a = 1052 + 691 = 1743. Define Penguin as Y; l = b + a = 1743 + 691 = 2434; so Y = 426 + l = 426 + 2434 = 2860. Define Crow as M; i = Y + a = 2860 + 691 = 3551; D = i + b = 3551 + 1743 = 5294; so M = 537 + D = 537 + 5294 = 5831. Define Owl as K; N = M = 5831; so K = 676 + N = 676 + 5831 = 6507. Define Parrot as I; so I = K + X = 6507 + 1052 = 7559. Answer: 7559.

- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Blue Jay, the number of Eagle, and the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot is 457 + 378 = 835.
- The number of Blue Jay is 553 + 835 = 1388.
- The number of Crow is Sparrow + Eagle + Blue Jay = Owl + Blue Jay + Eagle + Parrot = 267 + 1388 + 378 + 835 = 3568.

**Answer: 3568**<eos>
Define Eagle as R; so R = 378. Define Parrot as i; t = R = 378; so i = 457 + t = 457 + 378 = 835. Define Blue Jay as a; Y = i = 835; so a = 553 + Y = 553 + 835 = 1388. Define Owl as Q; v = a + R = 1388 + 378 = 1766; b = v + i = 1766 + 835 = 2601; so Q = 267 + b = 267 + 2601 = 2868. Define Sparrow as d; A = Q + a = 2868 + 1388 = 4256; S = A + R = 4256 + 378 = 4634; so d = S + i = 4634 + 835 = 5469. Define Crow as c; O = d + R = 5469 + 378 = 5847; so c = O + a = 5847 + 1388 = 7235. Answer: 7235.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Hawk equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Owl, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 440.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 282 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Eagle, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 13 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals 260 plus the number of Crow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Eagle equals the number of Hawk, which is 13 + 440 = 453.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 282 + 440 = 722.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Owl, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Eagle.
Therefore, the number of Crow equals Sparrow + Owl + Blue Jay + Eagle = Sparrow + 440 + 722 + 453 = Sparrow + 1615.
- The number of Parrot equals 260 + the number of Crow.
Therefore, the number of Parrot equals 260 + (Sparrow + 1615) = Sparrow + 1875.

**Answer: Answer: Sparrow + 1875**<eos>
Define Owl as v; so v = 440. Define Blue Jay as V; A = v = 440; so V = 282 + A = 282 + 440 = 722. Define Eagle as z; B = V = 722; so z = 13 + B = 13 + 722 = 735. Define Hawk as h; so h = z = 735. Define Sparrow as I; T = h + z = 735 + 735 = 1470; so I = T + v = 1470 + 440 = 1910. Define Crow as P; S = I + v = 1910 + 440 = 2350; U = S + V = 2350 + 722 = 3072; so P = U + z = 3072 + 735 = 3807. Define Parrot as K; i = P = 3807; so K = 260 + i = 260 + 3807 = 4067. Answer: 4067.

- The number of Deer equals 278 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Wolf equals 946 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Deer, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 695 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Fox, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals 894.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Fox, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals 537 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Elephant is 537 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox is 894.
- Therefore, the number of Elephant is 537 + 894 = 1431.
- The number of Deer is 278 plus the number of Elephant.
- Therefore, the number of Deer is 278 + 1431 = 1709.
- The number of Wolf is 946 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Deer, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon is the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Fox, and the number of Elephant.
- Therefore, the number of Raccoon is (695 + 894) + 1431 = 3010.
- The number of Wolf is 946 + 3010 = 3956.

**Answer: 3956**<eos>
Define Fox as X; so X = 894. Define Elephant as t; J = X = 894; so t = 537 + J = 537 + 894 = 1431. Define Deer as h; B = t = 1431; so h = 278 + B = 278 + 1431 = 1709. Define Bear as p; A = h + X = 1709 + 894 = 2603; M = A + t = 2603 + 1431 = 4034; so p = 695 + M = 695 + 4034 = 4729. Define Raccoon as k; K = p + X = 4729 + 894 = 5623; so k = K + t = 5623 + 1431 = 7054. Define Wolf as C; Y = k + h = 7054 + 1709 = 8763; z = Y + X = 8763 + 894 = 9657; so C = 946 + z = 946 + 9657 = 10603. Answer: 10603.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals 565 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Deer.
- The number of Tiger equals 949 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 378.
- The number of Bear equals 932 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Fox equals 415 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 428 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Deer, and the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox equals 415 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 428 plus the number of Deer.
- Therefore, the number of Fox equals 415 + (428 + 378) = 1221.
- The number of Raccoon equals 565 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Deer.
- Therefore, the number of Raccoon equals 565 + (1221 + 378) = 2066.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Deer, and the number of Fox.
- Therefore, the number of Wolf equals 2066 + 378 + 1221 = 3665.
- The number of Bear equals 932 plus the number of Tiger.
- Therefore, the number of Bear equals 932 + 949 = 1881.

**Answer: 1881**<eos>
Define Deer as T; so T = 378. Define Elephant as m; y = T = 378; so m = 428 + y = 428 + 378 = 806. Define Fox as M; O = m + T = 806 + 378 = 1184; so M = 415 + O = 415 + 1184 = 1599. Define Raccoon as F; h = M + T = 1599 + 378 = 1977; so F = 565 + h = 565 + 1977 = 2542. Define Wolf as l; i = F + T = 2542 + 378 = 2920; so l = i + M = 2920 + 1599 = 4519. Define Tiger as Y; G = l = 4519; so Y = 949 + G = 949 + 4519 = 5468. Define Bear as d; k = Y = 5468; so d = 932 + k = 932 + 5468 = 6400. Answer: 6400.
**arguments:**

- the number of raccoon equals 565 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of deer.
- the number of tiger equals 949 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of deer equals 378.
- the number of bear equals 932 plus the number of tiger.
- the number of fox equals 415 plus the sum of the number of elephant and the number of deer.
- the number of elephant equals 428 plus the number of deer.
- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of raccoon, the number of deer, and the number of fox.

**calculation:**

- the number of fox equals 415 plus the sum of the number of elephant and the number of deer.
- the number of elephant equals 428 plus the number of deer.
- therefore, the number of fox equals 415 + (428 + 378) = 1221.
- the number of raccoon equals 565 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of deer.
- therefore, the number of raccoon equals 565 + (1221 + 378) = 2066.
- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of raccoon, the number of deer, and the number of fox.
- therefore, the number of wolf equals 2066 + 378 + 1221 = 3665.
- the number of bear equals 932 plus the number of tiger.
- therefore, the number of bear equals 932 + 949 = 1881.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Fox, the number of Tiger, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Tiger equals 832 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals 728 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 416.
- The number of Wolf equals 116 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 872 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Deer as:
Number of Deer = Number of Elephant + Number of Fox + Number of Tiger + Number of Wolf
- We can also calculate the number of Tiger as:
Number of Tiger = 832 + Number of Raccoon
- And the number of Bear as:
Number of Bear = 728 + Number of Deer
- From the given relationships between the animal types, we can find:
Number of Elephant = Number of Fox
Number of Fox = 872 + Number of Wolf
Number of Wolf = 116 + Number of Tiger + Number of Raccoon
- Substituting the above equations into each other, we can eliminate all variables except for the number of Bear.
- Solving for the number of Bear, we get:
Number of Bear = 728 + (832 + 416) = 728 + 1248 = 1976

**Answer: 1976**<eos>
Define Raccoon as z; so z = 416. Define Tiger as S; y = z = 416; so S = 832 + y = 832 + 416 = 1248. Define Wolf as v; l = S + z = 1248 + 416 = 1664; so v = 116 + l = 116 + 1664 = 1780. Define Fox as o; x = v = 1780; so o = 872 + x = 872 + 1780 = 2652. Define Elephant as B; so B = o = 2652. Define Deer as V; k = B + o = 2652 + 2652 = 5304; L = k + S = 5304 + 1248 = 6552; so V = L + v = 6552 + 1780 = 8332. Define Bear as t; D = V = 8332; so t = 728 + D = 728 + 8332 = 9060. Answer: 9060.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals 852 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 819.
- The number of Elephant equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 35 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Fox.
- The number of Lion equals 137 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 346 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 236 plus the number of Lion.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger is 852 + (number of Wolf) + (number of Fox) = 852 + x + y.
- The number of Bear is (852 + x + y) + 819 = 1671 + x + y.
- The number of Elephant is the same as the number of Raccoon, which is 35 + x.
- Therefore, the number of Elephant is 35 + x.

**Answer: 35 + x**<eos>
Define Deer as J; so J = 819. Define Fox as P; W = J = 819; so P = 346 + W = 346 + 819 = 1165. Define Lion as k; V = P = 1165; so k = 137 + V = 137 + 1165 = 1302. Define Wolf as x; N = k = 1302; so x = 236 + N = 236 + 1302 = 1538. Define Tiger as Q; l = x + P = 1538 + 1165 = 2703; so Q = 852 + l = 852 + 2703 = 3555. Define Bear as c; so c = Q + J = 3555 + 819 = 4374. Define Raccoon as E; M = c + P = 4374 + 1165 = 5539; so E = 35 + M = 35 + 5539 = 5574. Define Elephant as n; so n = E = 5574. Answer: 5574.

- The number of Blue Jay is 405 plus the number of Owl. Since the number of Owl is 639, the number of Blue Jay is 405 + 639 = 1044.
- The number of Penguin is 307 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Sparrow. Since the number of Hawk and Sparrow is 525 + 499 = 1024, the number of Penguin is 307 + 1024 = 1331.
- The number of Crow is the same as the number of Penguin, which is 1331.

**Answer: 1331**<eos>
Define Owl as Q; so Q = 639. Define Blue Jay as R; u = Q = 639; so R = 405 + u = 405 + 639 = 1044. Define Sparrow as K; o = R + Q = 1044 + 639 = 1683; so K = 499 + o = 499 + 1683 = 2182. Define Peacock as d; c = K + R = 2182 + 1044 = 3226; so d = 332 + c = 332 + 3226 = 3558. Define Eagle as k; so k = d + Q = 3558 + 639 = 4197. Define Hawk as P; q = k = 4197; so P = 525 + q = 525 + 4197 = 4722. Define Penguin as h; T = P + K = 4722 + 2182 = 6904; so h = 307 + T = 307 + 6904 = 7211. Define Crow as y; so y = h = 7211.

**Answer: 1603**<eos>
Define Fox as K; so K = 107. Define Elephant as g; so g = K = 107. Define Deer as I; B = g + K = 107 + 107 = 214; so I = 225 + B = 225 + 214 = 439. Define Tiger as i; q = I = 439; so i = 660 + q = 660 + 439 = 1099. Define Wolf as W; Y = i = 1099; so W = 760 + Y = 760 + 1099 = 1859. Define Raccoon as f; T = W + g = 1859 + 107 = 1966; j = T + i = 1966 + 1099 = 3065; so f = 76 + j = 76 + 3065 = 3141. Define Bear as H; b = f + K = 3141 + 107 = 3248; so H = b + g = 3248 + 107 = 3355. Answer: 3355.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 951 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Peacock.
- The number of Peacock equals 141 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Penguin.
- The number of Owl equals 330 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Parrot equals 372 plus the number of Hawk.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Crow = the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Peacock
= the sum of 0 and 141
= 141
- The number of Sparrow = 951 + the number of Crow
= 951 + 141
= 1092

**Answer: 1092**<eos>
Define Hawk as r; so r = 756. Define Parrot as B; w = r = 756; so B = 372 + w = 372 + 756 = 1128. Define Owl as V; J = B + r = 1128 + 756 = 1884; so V = 330 + J = 330 + 1884 = 2214. Define Penguin as N; so N = V = 2214. Define Blue Jay as U; so U = N = 2214. Define Peacock as s; E = U + r = 2214 + 756 = 2970; so s = 141 + E = 141 + 2970 = 3111. Define Eagle as k; so k = s + V = 3111 + 2214 = 5325. Define Crow as n; so n = k + s = 5325 + 3111 = 8436. Define Sparrow as q; t = n = 8436; so q = 951 + t = 951 + 8436 = 9387. Answer: 9387.
**arguments:**

- the number of sparrow equals 951 plus the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of eagle and the number of peacock.
- the number of peacock equals 141 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of hawk.

**Answer:**

**Answer: 77 + Sparrow**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as d; so d = 248. Define Penguin as r; w = d = 248; so r = 525 + w = 525 + 248 = 773. Define Owl as q; H = r + d = 773 + 248 = 1021; so q = 921 + H = 921 + 1021 = 1942. Define Parrot as Q; so Q = q + r = 1942 + 773 = 2715. Define Eagle as A; so A = Q = 2715. Define Crow as y; O = A = 2715; so y = 12 + O = 12 + 2715 = 2727. Define Sparrow as G; V = y + r = 2727 + 773 = 3500; so G = 936 + V = 936 + 3500 = 4436. Define Peacock as T; e = G = 4436; so T = 77 + e = 77 + 4436 = 4513. Answer: 4513.

- The number of Parrot equals 629 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 530.
- The number of Sparrow equals 385 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Hawk = 389 + (Sparrow + Blue Jay) = 389 + (385 + 530) = 389 + 915 = 1304.
- The number of Crow = Hawk = 1304.
- The number of Owl = 131 + Eagle = 131 + (609 + Crow + Sparrow + Hawk) = 131 + (609 + 1304 + 385 + 1304) = 131 + 2623 = 2754.
- The number of Eagle = 609 + Crow + Sparrow + Hawk = 609 + 1304 + 385 + 1304 = 3692.
- The number of Parrot = 629 + Owl = 629 + 2754 = 3383.

**Answer: 3383**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as G; so G = 530. Define Sparrow as Q; M = G = 530; so Q = 385 + M = 385 + 530 = 915. Define Hawk as e; i = Q + G = 915 + 530 = 1445; so e = 389 + i = 389 + 1445 = 1834. Define Crow as b; so b = e = 1834. Define Eagle as N; B = b + Q = 1834 + 915 = 2749; U = B + e = 2749 + 1834 = 4583; so N = 609 + U = 609 + 4583 = 5192. Define Owl as s; j = N = 5192; so s = 131 + j = 131 + 5192 = 5323. Define Parrot as P; o = s = 5323; so P = 629 + o = 629 + 5323 = 5952. Answer: 5952.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals 723.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Bear.
- The number of Raccoon equals 803 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Tiger, and the number of Lion.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Fox, the number of Lion, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Horse equals 655 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Lion equals 338 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 577.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf equals the number of Deer (given).
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Fox (given).
- The number of Raccoon equals 803 + Wolf + Tiger + Lion (given).
- The number of Fox equals the number of Bear (given).
- The number of Bear equals 577 (given).
- The number of Horse equals 655 + Raccoon (given).

Substituting the values we get:

Number of Horse = 655 + (803 + Wolf + Tiger + Lion) + Fox
= 655 + (803 + 577 + 338 + Fox) + Fox
= 655 + 1718 + 2*Fox
= 2373 + 2*Fox

**Answer: Answer: 2373 + 2*Fox**<eos>
Define Bear as K; so K = 577. Define Fox as T; so T = K = 577. Define Lion as w; P = T = 577; so w = 338 + P = 338 + 577 = 915. Define Tiger as I; so I = w + T = 915 + 577 = 1492. Define Wolf as m; L = I + T = 1492 + 577 = 2069; A = L + w = 2069 + 915 = 2984; so m = A + K = 2984 + 577 = 3561. Define Raccoon as x; s = m + I = 3561 + 1492 = 5053; i = s + w = 5053 + 915 = 5968; so x = 803 + i = 803 + 5968 = 6771. Define Horse as U; C = x = 6771; so U = 655 + C = 655 + 6771 = 7426. Answer: 7426.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the number of wolf.
- the number of elephant equals 723.
- the number of fox equals the number of bear.
- the number of raccoon equals 803 plus the sum of the number of wolf, the number of tiger, and the number of lion.
- the number of tiger equals the sum of the number of lion and the number of fox.
- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of tiger, the number of fox, the number of lion, and the number of bear.
- the number of horse equals 655 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of lion equals 338 plus the number of fox.
- the number of bear equals 577.

**calculation:**

- the number of wolf equals the number of deer (given).
- the number of tiger equals the sum of the number of lion and the number of fox (given).
- the number of raccoon equals 803 + wolf + tiger + lion (given).
- the number of fox equals the number of bear (given).
- the number of bear equals 577 (given).
- the number of horse equals 655 + raccoon (given).

substituting the values we get:

number of horse = 655 + (803 + wolf + tiger + lion) + fox
= 655 + (803 + 577 + 338 + fox) + fox
= 655 + 1718 + 2*fox
= 2373 + 2*fox

**Arguments:**

- The number of Penguin equals 935 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Crow, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals 967 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 553.
- The number of Sparrow equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 731 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Penguin, the number of Parrot, and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay = Hawk + Sparrow = Sparrow + Crow + Parrot = 553 + 553 + 731 = 1837.
- The number of Owl = Penguin + Parrot + Blue Jay = 935 + 731 + 1837 = 3503.

**Answer: 3503**<eos>
Define Crow as H; so H = 553. Define Eagle as p; G = H = 553; so p = 967 + G = 967 + 553 = 1520. Define Parrot as O; l = p + H = 1520 + 553 = 2073; so O = 731 + l = 731 + 2073 = 2804. Define Sparrow as Q; so Q = O = 2804. Define Hawk as w; Y = Q + H = 2804 + 553 = 3357; so w = Y + O = 3357 + 2804 = 6161. Define Blue Jay as q; so q = w + Q = 6161 + 2804 = 8965. Define Penguin as L; e = q = 8965; so L = 935 + e = 935 + 8965 = 9900. Define Owl as I; C = L + O = 9900 + 2804 = 12704; so I = C + q = 12704 + 8965 = 21669. Answer: 21669.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Hawk equals the number of Owl.
- The number of Peacock equals 581 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 209 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 203 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals the number of Peacock.
- The number of Penguin equals 503 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Sparrow equals 70 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Peacock.
- The number of Eagle equals 135.
- The number of Crow equals 676 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Hawk equals the number of Owl, so let's assume both are x.
- The number of Peacock is 581 plus the number of Eagle, so we have Peacock = 581 + x.
- The number of Blue Jay is 209 plus the number of Parrot, so we have Blue Jay = 209 + Parrot.
- The number of Owl is 203 plus the number of Blue Jay, so we have Owl = 203 + (209 + Parrot).
- Since Parrot equals Peacock, we can substitute Peacock for Parrot in the above equation: Owl = 203 + (209 + Peacock).
- The number of Penguin is 503 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Blue Jay, so we have Penguin = 503 + Hawk + Blue Jay.
- The number of Sparrow is 70 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Peacock, so we have Sparrow = 70 + Penguin + Peacock.
- The number of Eagle is 135.
- The number of Crow is 676 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle, so we have Crow = 676 + Parrot + Eagle.

**Final Answer:**

Sparrow = 70 + Penguin + Peacock
Sparrow = 70 + (503 + Hawk + Blue Jay) + (581 + x)
Sparrow = 70 + 503 + x + 209 + x
**Answer: Sparrow = 781 + 2x**<eos>
Define Eagle as F; so F = 135. Define Peacock as i; v = F = 135; so i = 581 + v = 581 + 135 = 716. Define Parrot as u; so u = i = 716. Define Blue Jay as l; s = u = 716; so l = 209 + s = 209 + 716 = 925. Define Owl as r; a = l = 925; so r = 203 + a = 203 + 925 = 1128. Define Hawk as S; so S = r = 1128. Define Penguin as G; O = S + l = 1128 + 925 = 2053; so G = 503 + O = 503 + 2053 = 2556. Define Sparrow as B; g = G + i = 2556 + 716 = 3272; so B = 70 + g = 70 + 3272 = 3342. Answer: 3342.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Penguin, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Crow, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Penguin equals 148 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 430.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 472 plus the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl as:
Number of Owl = Number of Crow + Number of Penguin + Number of Parrot
Number of Owl = (Number of Penguin + Number of Eagle) + 148 + Number of Parrot
Number of Owl = (148 + Number of Parrot) + Number of Parrot
Number of Owl = 148 + 2 * Number of Parrot

- From the given information, we can also calculate the number of Hawk as:
Number of Hawk = Number of Blue Jay + Number of Crow + Number of Sparrow + Number of Owl
Number of Hawk = 472 + (Number of Penguin + Number of Eagle) + 430 + (148 + 2 * Number of Parrot)
Number of Hawk = 472 + 148 + 2 * Number of Parrot + Number of Eagle + 430
Number of Hawk = 1340 + 2 * Number of Parrot + Number of Eagle

- However, we are not given any information about the number of Eagle or the number of Parrot, so we cannot calculate the exact number of Hawk.

**Answer: Cannot be determined**<eos>
Define Sparrow as l; so l = 430. Define Eagle as I; so I = l = 430. Define Parrot as v; so v = I = 430. Define Penguin as R; q = v = 430; so R = 148 + q = 148 + 430 = 578. Define Crow as y; so y = R + I = 578 + 430 = 1008. Define Owl as L; r = y + R = 1008 + 578 = 1586; so L = r + v = 1586 + 430 = 2016. Define Blue Jay as u; W = L = 2016; so u = 472 + W = 472 + 2016 = 2488. Define Hawk as H; C = u + y = 2488 + 1008 = 3496; P = C + l = 3496 + 430 = 3926; so H = P + L = 3926 + 2016 = 5942. Answer: 5942.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of crow, the number of penguin, and the number of parrot.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of penguin and the number of eagle.
- the number of hawk equals the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of crow, the number of sparrow, and the number of owl.
- the number of parrot equals the number of eagle.
- the number of penguin equals 148 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of eagle equals the number of sparrow.
- the number of sparrow equals 430.
- the number of blue jay equals 472 plus the number of owl.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of owl as:
number of owl = number of crow + number of penguin + number of parrot
number of owl = (number of penguin + number of eagle) + 148 + number of parrot
number of owl = (148 + number of parrot) + number of parrot
number of owl = 148 + 2 * number of parrot

- from the given information, we can also calculate the number of hawk as:
number of hawk = number of blue jay + number of crow + number of sparrow + number of owl
number of hawk = 472 + (number of penguin + number of eagle) + 430 + (148 + 2 * number of parrot)
number of hawk = 472 + 148 + 2 * number of parrot + number of eagle + 430
number of hawk = 1340 + 2 * number of parrot + number of eagle

- however, we are not given any information about the number of eagle or the number of parrot, so we cannot calculate the exact number of hawk.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 830 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 542 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Deer equals 697.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Deer, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Elephant.
- The number of Raccoon equals 547 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals 536 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Tiger equals the number of Wolf. Therefore, let's assume both are x.
- The number of Bear equals 830 plus the number of Deer, so x = 830 + d.
- The number of Elephant equals 542 plus the number of Lion, so x = 542 + l.
- The number of Deer equals 697.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Deer, and the number of Bear, so l = r + d + x.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Elephant, so x = l.
- The number of Raccoon equals 547 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer, so r = 547 + x + d.
- The number of Fox equals 536 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Deer, so f = 536 + x + d.

**Answer:**

**Answer: f = 536 + x + d**<eos>
Define Deer as d; so d = 697. Define Bear as F; y = d = 697; so F = 830 + y = 830 + 697 = 1527. Define Raccoon as a; G = F + d = 1527 + 697 = 2224; so a = 547 + G = 547 + 2224 = 2771. Define Lion as k; A = a + d = 2771 + 697 = 3468; so k = A + F = 3468 + 1527 = 4995. Define Elephant as C; J = k = 4995; so C = 542 + J = 542 + 4995 = 5537. Define Wolf as c; so c = C = 5537. Define Tiger as O; so O = c = 5537. Define Fox as X; z = O + d = 5537 + 697 = 6234; so X = 536 + z = 536 + 6234 = 6770. Answer: 6770.
**arguments:**

- the number of tiger equals the number of wolf.
- the number of bear equals 830 plus the number of deer.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals 296 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Eagle, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 394 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 315 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Eagle, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Eagle equals 168.
- The number of Sparrow equals 555 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 867 plus the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl as:
Owl = 296 + (Blue Jay + Eagle + Crow)
- We can also calculate the number of Crow as:
Crow = 394 + (Sparrow + Eagle)
- And the number of Sparrow as:
Sparrow = 555 + Eagle
- Substituting these expressions into the equation for Owl, we get:
Owl = 296 + (867 + Parrot + 168 + Crow)
- Combining like terms, we find:
Owl = 296 + 1035 + Parrot + Crow
- Therefore, the number of Owl is:
**Answer: 1331 + Parrot + Crow**<eos>
Define Eagle as a; so a = 168. Define Sparrow as y; M = a = 168; so y = 555 + M = 555 + 168 = 723. Define Crow as B; F = y + a = 723 + 168 = 891; so B = 394 + F = 394 + 891 = 1285. Define Parrot as W; w = B + a = 1285 + 168 = 1453; t = w + y = 1453 + 723 = 2176; so W = 315 + t = 315 + 2176 = 2491. Define Blue Jay as e; v = W = 2491; so e = 867 + v = 867 + 2491 = 3358. Define Owl as O; Q = e + a = 3358 + 168 = 3526; c = Q + B = 3526 + 1285 = 4811; so O = 296 + c = 296 + 4811 = 5107. Answer: 5107.

- The number of Eagle is 226 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Hawk, which is 226 + 3171 + 1265 = 6702.
- The number of Blue Jay is 627 plus the number of Eagle, which is 627 + 6702 = 7329.

**Answer: 7329**<eos>
Define Sparrow as W; so W = 943. Define Hawk as k; e = W = 943; so k = 322 + e = 322 + 943 = 1265. Define Owl as Y; d = k + W = 1265 + 943 = 2208; so Y = 455 + d = 455 + 2208 = 2663. Define Parrot as a; M = Y = 2663; so a = 294 + M = 294 + 2663 = 2957. Define Crow as w; b = a + W = 2957 + 943 = 3900; so w = 124 + b = 124 + 3900 = 4024. Define Eagle as U; v = w + k = 4024 + 1265 = 5289; so U = 226 + v = 226 + 5289 = 5515. Define Blue Jay as C; A = U = 5515; so C = 627 + A = 627 + 5515 = 6142. Answer: 6142.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals the number of Lion.
- The number of Fox equals 981.
- The number of Kangaroo equals 628 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 570 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals 197 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Kangaroo and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Horse and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Horse equals 72 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 490.
- The number of Tiger equals the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Wolf equals the number of Lion.
- Therefore, the number of Tiger equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Kangaroo and the number of Raccoon, which is 490 + (number of Raccoon).
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Horse and the number of Elephant, which is (72 + (number of Bear and the number of Deer)).
- The number of Horse equals 72 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Deer, which is 72 + (number of Bear) + (number of Deer).
- The number of Deer equals 570 plus the number of Elephant, which is 570 + (number of Elephant).
- The number of Elephant equals 197 plus the number of Raccoon, which is 197 + (number of Raccoon).
- The number of Raccoon equals 490.

**Substituting the above equations into each other, we can solve for the number of Tiger:**

Number of Tiger = Number of Wolf = Number of Lion
= 72 + (number of Bear) + (number of Deer)
= 72 + (490 + (number of Raccoon)) + (570 + (number of Elephant))
= 72 + 490 + 570 + 197 + (number of Raccoon)
= 1849 + (number of Raccoon)

**Answer: 1849 + (number of Raccoon)**<eos>
Define Raccoon as v; so v = 490. Define Elephant as A; N = v = 490; so A = 197 + N = 197 + 490 = 687. Define Deer as S; g = A = 687; so S = 570 + g = 570 + 687 = 1257. Define Kangaroo as J; B = S = 1257; so J = 628 + B = 628 + 1257 = 1885. Define Bear as x; so x = J + v = 1885 + 490 = 2375. Define Horse as V; R = x + S = 2375 + 1257 = 3632; so V = 72 + R = 72 + 3632 = 3704. Define Lion as q; so q = V + A = 3704 + 687 = 4391. Define Wolf as a; so a = q = 4391. Define Tiger as u; so u = a = 4391. Answer: 4391.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals the number of lion.
- the number of fox equals 981.

- the number of elephant equals 197 plus the number of raccoon, which is 197 + (number of raccoon).
- the number of raccoon equals 490.

**substituting the above equations into each other, we can solve for the number of tiger:**

number of tiger = number of wolf = number of lion
= 72 + (number of bear) + (number of deer)
= 72 + (490 + (number of raccoon)) + (570 + (number of elephant))
= 72 + 490 + 570 + 197 + (number of raccoon)
= 1849 + (number of raccoon)

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 221 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 886.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Owl, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 523 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Hawk equals 729 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot equals 943 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Crow equals 935 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Sparrow = 221 + Crow + Owl = 221 + Crow + 886
- The number of Eagle = Parrot + Owl + Sparrow = 943 + 886 + 221
- The number of Hawk = 729 + Eagle + Sparrow = 729 + (943 + 886 + 221) + Sparrow
- Therefore, the number of Hawk = 729 + 1950 + Sparrow = 2679 + Sparrow

**Answer: 2679**<eos>
Define Owl as p; so p = 886. Define Blue Jay as h; r = p = 886; so h = 523 + r = 523 + 886 = 1409. Define Crow as K; G = h + p = 1409 + 886 = 2295; so K = 935 + G = 935 + 2295 = 3230. Define Sparrow as d; C = K + p = 3230 + 886 = 4116; so d = 221 + C = 221 + 4116 = 4337. Define Parrot as D; B = d = 4337; so D = 943 + B = 943 + 4337 = 5280. Define Eagle as X; y = D + p = 5280 + 886 = 6166; so X = y + d = 6166 + 4337 = 10503. Define Hawk as g; F = X + d = 10503 + 4337 = 14840; so g = 729 + F = 729 + 14840 = 15569. Answer: 15569.
**arguments:**

- the number of sparrow equals 221 plus the sum of the number of crow and the number of owl.
- the number of owl equals 886.
- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of parrot, the number of owl, and the number of sparrow.
- the number of blue jay equals 523 plus the number of owl.
- the number of hawk equals 729 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of sparrow.
- the number of parrot equals 943 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of crow equals 935 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of owl.

**calculation:**

- the number of sparrow = 221 + crow + owl = 221 + crow + 886
- the number of eagle = parrot + owl + sparrow = 943 + 886 + 221
- the number of hawk = 729 + eagle + sparrow = 729 + (943 + 886 + 221) + sparrow
- therefore, the number of hawk = 729 + 1950 + sparrow = 2679 + sparrow

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 785 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 807 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 80 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals 211.
- The number of Hawk equals 576 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Parrot as follows:
Number of Parrot = Number of Crow + Number of Owl + Number of Eagle + Number of Blue Jay
= 807 + Owl + 211 + 80
= 1098 + Owl

- We can also calculate the number of Sparrow as follows:
Number of Sparrow = 785 + Number of Parrot
= 785 + 1098 + Owl
= 1883 + Owl

**Answer: 1883 + Owl**<eos>
Define Eagle as U; so U = 211. Define Hawk as q; N = U = 211; so q = 576 + N = 576 + 211 = 787. Define Blue Jay as d; Y = q = 787; so d = 80 + Y = 80 + 787 = 867. Define Owl as a; so a = d = 867. Define Crow as s; A = a + q = 867 + 787 = 1654; so s = 807 + A = 807 + 1654 = 2461. Define Parrot as B; p = s + a = 2461 + 867 = 3328; i = p + U = 3328 + 211 = 3539; so B = i + d = 3539 + 867 = 4406. Define Sparrow as f; W = B = 4406; so f = 785 + W = 785 + 4406 = 5191. Answer: 5191.

- The number of Fox equals 657.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Elephant, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 841 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 486 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 27 plus the number of Raccoon.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Elephant = 841 + Deer + Fox
- The number of Elephant = 841 + 486 + 657 = 1984
- The number of Tiger = 149 + Elephant = 149 + 1984 = 2133
- The number of Wolf = Bear + Elephant + Tiger = 27 + 1984 + 2133 = 4394
- Answer: 4394<eos>
Define Fox as Q; so Q = 657. Define Deer as c; p = Q = 657; so c = 486 + p = 486 + 657 = 1143. Define Elephant as q; g = c + Q = 1143 + 657 = 1800; so q = 841 + g = 841 + 1800 = 2641. Define Tiger as o; F = q = 2641; so o = 149 + F = 149 + 2641 = 2790. Define Raccoon as T; f = o + q = 2790 + 2641 = 5431; so T = f + c = 5431 + 1143 = 6574. Define Bear as k; j = T = 6574; so k = 27 + j = 27 + 6574 = 6601. Define Wolf as y; l = k + q = 6601 + 2641 = 9242; so y = l + o = 9242 + 2790 = 12032. Answer: 12032.

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question!

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Raccoon, the number of Wolf, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Elephant equals 162 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 519 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 255 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Bear, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon equals 889 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 424.

**Calculation:**

- From the equation "The number of Elephant equals 162 plus the number of Wolf", we can get the number of Wolf:
Number of Wolf = Number of Elephant - 162
- From the equation "The number of Wolf equals 255 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Bear, and the number of Fox", we can get the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Bear, and the number of Fox:
Sum of Raccoon, Bear, and Fox = Number of Wolf - 255
- From the equation "The number of Raccoon equals 889 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Bear", we can get the number of Fox:
Number of Fox = (Number of Raccoon - 889) - Number of Bear
- Substitute the above equations into the equation "The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Raccoon, the number of Wolf, and the number of Bear", we can get:
Number of Deer = (162 + Number of Wolf) + (Number of Raccoon - 889) - Number of Bear + Number of Bear
- Simplify the equation:
Number of Deer = 162 + Number of Wolf + Number of Raccoon - 889
- Substitute the value of Number of Wolf and Number of Raccoon from the previous equations:
Number of Deer = 162 + (Number of Elephant - 162) + (889 + Number of Fox - Number of Bear) - 889
- Simplify the equation:
Number of Deer = Number of Elephant + Number of Fox
- Substitute the value of Number of Elephant and Number of Fox:
Number of Deer = 162 + 519
**Answer: 681**<eos>
Define Bear as g; so g = 424. Define Fox as T; Q = g = 424; so T = 519 + Q = 519 + 424 = 943. Define Raccoon as F; a = T + g = 943 + 424 = 1367; so F = 889 + a = 889 + 1367 = 2256. Define Wolf as E; D = F + g = 2256 + 424 = 2680; A = D + T = 2680 + 943 = 3623; so E = 255 + A = 255 + 3623 = 3878. Define Elephant as X; Y = E = 3878; so X = 162 + Y = 162 + 3878 = 4040. Define Deer as W; o = X + F = 4040 + 2256 = 6296; r = o + E = 6296 + 3878 = 10174; so W = r + g = 10174 + 424 = 10598. Answer: 10598.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of elephant, the number of raccoon, the number of wolf, and the number of bear.
- the number of elephant equals 162 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of fox equals 519 plus the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals 255 plus the sum of the number of raccoon, the number of bear, and the number of fox.
- the number of raccoon equals 889 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 424.

**calculation:**

- from the equation "the number of elephant equals 162 plus the number of wolf", we can get the number of wolf:
number of wolf = number of elephant - 162
- from the equation "the number of wolf equals 255 plus the sum of the number of raccoon, the number of bear, and the number of fox", we can get the sum of the number of raccoon, the number of bear, and the number of fox:
sum of raccoon, bear, and fox = number of wolf - 255
- from the equation "the number of raccoon equals 889 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of bear", we can get the number of fox:
number of fox = (number of raccoon - 889) - number of bear
- substitute the above equations into the equation "the number of deer equals the sum of the number of elephant, the number of raccoon, the number of wolf, and the number of bear", we can get:
number of deer = (162 + number of wolf) + (number of raccoon - 889) - number of bear + number of bear
- simplify the equation:
number of deer = 162 + number of wolf + number of raccoon - 889
- substitute the value of number of wolf and number of raccoon from the previous equations:
number of deer = 162 + (number of elephant - 162) + (889 + number of fox - number of bear) - 889
- simplify the equation:
number of deer = number of elephant + number of fox
- substitute the value of number of elephant and number of fox:
number of deer = 162 + 519

- The number of Deer equals 35 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals 794 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Deer, and the number of Raccoon.
Tiger = Bear + Deer + Raccoon
Tiger = 491 + 35 + Elephant
Tiger = 526 + Elephant
- The number of Wolf equals 150 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Elephant.
Wolf = 150 + (526 + Elephant)
Wolf = 676 + Elephant
- The number of Elephant equals 598.
Therefore,
Wolf = 676 + 598
**Answer: 1274**<eos>
Define Elephant as M; so M = 598. Define Deer as c; x = M = 598; so c = 35 + x = 35 + 598 = 633. Define Fox as g; Q = c + M = 633 + 598 = 1231; so g = 794 + Q = 794 + 1231 = 2025. Define Raccoon as J; t = g + M = 2025 + 598 = 2623; so J = t + c = 2623 + 633 = 3256. Define Bear as T; z = J = 3256; so T = 491 + z = 491 + 3256 = 3747. Define Tiger as S; d = T + c = 3747 + 633 = 4380; so S = d + J = 4380 + 3256 = 7636. Define Wolf as L; I = S + M = 7636 + 598 = 8234; so L = 150 + I = 150 + 8234 = 8384. Answer: 8384.

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated. Problem: The number of Fox equals 331 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Raccoon. The number of Wolf equals 725 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Raccoon.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 331 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Wolf equals 725 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals 882 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Deer, and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Deer equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 252 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Elephant equals 673 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Tiger equals 168.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon is 252 plus the number of Tiger = 252 + 168 = 420.
- The number of Deer is equal to the number of Raccoon = 420.
- The number of Fox is 331 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Raccoon = 331 + 420 + 420 = 1171.
- The number of Elephant is 673 plus the number of Fox = 673 + 1171 = 1844.
- The number of Wolf is 725 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Raccoon = 725 + 1844 + 420 = 3989.
- The number of Bear is 882 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Deer, and the number of Tiger = 882 + 3989 + 420 + 168 = 5459.

**Answer: 5459**<eos>
Define Tiger as X; so X = 168. Define Raccoon as H; P = X = 168; so H = 252 + P = 252 + 168 = 420. Define Deer as w; so w = H = 420. Define Fox as U; p = w + H = 420 + 420 = 840; so U = 331 + p = 331 + 840 = 1171. Define Elephant as u; O = U = 1171; so u = 673 + O = 673 + 1171 = 1844. Define Wolf as c; e = u + H = 1844 + 420 = 2264; so c = 725 + e = 725 + 2264 = 2989. Define Bear as R; N = c + w = 2989 + 420 = 3409; v = N + X = 3409 + 168 = 3577; so R = 882 + v = 882 + 3577 = 4459. Answer: 4459.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Horse equals 399 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Deer, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Horse.
- The number of Elephant equals 583 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals 307 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Deer, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Lion equals 255 plus the number of Horse.
- The number of Bear equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 802.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Tiger as follows:
Number of Tiger = Number of Horse - Number of Wolf - Number of Deer - Number of Elephant
= 399 - (Sum of Wolf, Deer, and Elephant) - 583
= 399 - (307 + 802) - 583
= 399 - 1109 - 583
= -1223

**Answer: -1223**<eos>
Define Deer as Y; so Y = 802. Define Fox as d; O = Y = 802; so d = 307 + O = 307 + 802 = 1109. Define Elephant as G; E = d + Y = 1109 + 802 = 1911; so G = 583 + E = 583 + 1911 = 2494. Define Wolf as c; P = G + Y = 2494 + 802 = 3296; so c = P + d = 3296 + 1109 = 4405. Define Horse as N; l = c + Y = 4405 + 802 = 5207; I = l + G = 5207 + 2494 = 7701; so N = 399 + I = 399 + 7701 = 8100. Define Lion as V; U = N = 8100; so V = 255 + U = 255 + 8100 = 8355. Define Tiger as m; so m = V + N = 8355 + 8100 = 16455. Answer: 16455.
**arguments:**

- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of tiger and the number of elephant.
- the number of horse equals 399 plus the sum of the number of wolf, the number of deer, and the number of elephant.
- the number of tiger equals the sum of the number of lion and the number of horse.
- the number of elephant equals 583 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of deer.
- the number of fox equals 307 plus the number of deer.
- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of elephant, the number of deer, and the number of fox.
- the number of lion equals 255 plus the number of horse.
- the number of bear equals the number of fox.
- the number of deer equals 802.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of tiger as follows:
number of tiger = number of horse - number of wolf - number of deer - number of elephant
= 399 - (sum of wolf, deer, and elephant) - 583
= 399 - (307 + 802) - 583
= 399 - 1109 - 583
= -1223

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 201 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon equals 567 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Lion equals 756 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 395 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Tiger equals 536 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 104.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Fox as follows:
Number of Fox = Number of Wolf = 395

- We can also calculate the number of Raccoon as follows:
Number of Raccoon = 567 + Number of Lion = 567 + 756 = 1323

- Using the relationship between Elephant, Raccoon, and Fox, we can find the number of Elephant as follows:
Number of Elephant = 201 + Number of Raccoon + Number of Fox = 201 + 1323 + 395 = 2719

**Answer: 2719**<eos>
Define Bear as D; so D = 104. Define Tiger as x; n = D = 104; so x = 536 + n = 536 + 104 = 640. Define Deer as G; e = x + D = 640 + 104 = 744; so G = 550 + e = 550 + 744 = 1294. Define Wolf as M; k = G = 1294; so M = 395 + k = 395 + 1294 = 1689. Define Fox as I; so I = M = 1689. Define Lion as a; J = I = 1689; so a = 756 + J = 756 + 1689 = 2445. Define Raccoon as N; y = a = 2445; so N = 567 + y = 567 + 2445 = 3012. Define Elephant as V; o = N + I = 3012 + 1689 = 4701; so V = 201 + o = 201 + 4701 = 4902. Answer: 4902.
**arguments:**

- the number of elephant equals 201 plus the sum of the number of raccoon and the number of fox.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 318 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk equals 11 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Sparrow equals 87.
- The number of Owl equals 922 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Owl, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 994 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Owl = 922 + 87 = 1009.
- The number of Crow = Hawk + Owl + Sparrow + Eagle
= (11 + 994) + 1009 + 87 + 318
= 1113 + 1009 + 87 + 318
= 2327.

**Answer: 2327**<eos>
Define Sparrow as X; so X = 87. Define Owl as l; m = X = 87; so l = 922 + m = 922 + 87 = 1009. Define Eagle as p; C = l + X = 1009 + 87 = 1096; so p = 318 + C = 318 + 1096 = 1414. Define Blue Jay as E; J = p + X = 1414 + 87 = 1501; so E = J + l = 1501 + 1009 = 2510. Define Parrot as T; j = E = 2510; so T = 994 + j = 994 + 2510 = 3504. Define Hawk as N; z = T = 3504; so N = 11 + z = 11 + 3504 = 3515. Define Crow as K; e = N + l = 3515 + 1009 = 4524; O = e + X = 4524 + 87 = 4611; so K = O + p = 4611 + 1414 = 6025. Answer: 6025.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 318 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of sparrow.
- the number of hawk equals 11 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of sparrow equals 87.
- the number of owl equals 922 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of hawk, the number of owl, the number of sparrow, and the number of eagle.
- the number of parrot equals 994 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of eagle, the number of sparrow, and the number of owl.

**calculation:**

- the number of owl = 922 + 87 = 1009.
- the number of crow = hawk + owl + sparrow + eagle
= (11 + 994) + 1009 + 87 + 318
= 1113 + 1009 + 87 + 318
= 2327.

- The number of Blue Jay equals 671 plus the number of Peacock.
- The number of Eagle equals 998.
- The number of Parrot equals 852 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Penguin, and the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Penguin = 720 + 646 = 1366
- The number of Owl = 301 + 1366 = 1667
- The number of Hawk = 359 + (245 + 998) = 1642
- The number of Sparrow = 245 + (671 + 998) = 1734
- The number of Blue Jay = 671 + 720 = 1391
- The number of Parrot = 852 + 1734 + 1667 = 4253

**Answer: 4253**<eos>
Define Eagle as W; so W = 998. Define Owl as K; A = W = 998; so K = 301 + A = 301 + 998 = 1299. Define Penguin as Z; S = K = 1299; so Z = 646 + S = 646 + 1299 = 1945. Define Peacock as J; o = Z = 1945; so J = 720 + o = 720 + 1945 = 2665. Define Blue Jay as r; D = J = 2665; so r = 671 + D = 671 + 2665 = 3336. Define Sparrow as j; C = r + W = 3336 + 998 = 4334; so j = 245 + C = 245 + 4334 = 4579. Define Parrot as M; R = j + Z = 4579 + 1945 = 6524; O = R + K = 6524 + 1299 = 7823; so M = 852 + O = 852 + 7823 = 8675. Answer: 8675.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question!

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals 650 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 527.
- The number of Fox equals 971 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals 240 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Lion equals 163 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear.
- The number of Tiger equals 386 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals 835 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Deer is 835.
- The number of Raccoon is 650 + Deer = 650 + 835 = 1485.
- The number of Fox is 971 + Raccoon = 971 + 1485 = 2456.
- The number of Elephant is 240 + Fox = 240 + 2456 = 2696.
- The number of Lion is 163 + (Wolf + Bear) = 163 + Wolf.
- The number of Tiger is 386 + (Elephant + Fox) = 386 + (2696 + 2456) = 386 + 5152 = 5538.

**Answer: 5538**<eos>
Define Bear as x; so x = 527. Define Wolf as u; so u = x = 527. Define Lion as o; p = u + x = 527 + 527 = 1054; so o = 163 + p = 163 + 1054 = 1217. Define Deer as R; q = o = 1217; so R = 835 + q = 835 + 1217 = 2052. Define Raccoon as G; L = R = 2052; so G = 650 + L = 650 + 2052 = 2702. Define Fox as i; b = G = 2702; so i = 971 + b = 971 + 2702 = 3673. Define Elephant as r; e = i = 3673; so r = 240 + e = 240 + 3673 = 3913. Define Tiger as Y; C = r + i = 3913 + 3673 = 7586; so Y = 386 + C = 386 + 7586 = 7972. Answer: 7972.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 486.
- The number of Crow equals 253 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 743 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Sparrow equals 709 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Hawk equals 866 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 628 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 186 plus the number of Eagle.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot = 253 + number of Parrot
=> number of Parrot = 253
- The number of Blue Jay = 743 + Owl + Eagle
=> The number of Blue Jay = 743 + 186 + 486 = 1415
- The number of Sparrow = 709 + Crow
=> The number of Sparrow = 709 + 253 = 962
- The number of Hawk = 866 + Sparrow + Blue Jay
=> The number of Hawk = 866 + 962 + 1415 = 3243
- The number of Penguin = Hawk + Owl
=> The number of Penguin = 3243 + 186 = 3429

**Answer: 3429**<eos>
Define Eagle as s; so s = 486. Define Owl as I; Z = s = 486; so I = 186 + Z = 186 + 486 = 672. Define Blue Jay as V; e = I + s = 672 + 486 = 1158; so V = 743 + e = 743 + 1158 = 1901. Define Parrot as J; H = V + I = 1901 + 672 = 2573; so J = 628 + H = 628 + 2573 = 3201. Define Crow as B; O = J = 3201; so B = 253 + O = 253 + 3201 = 3454. Define Sparrow as l; z = B = 3454; so l = 709 + z = 709 + 3454 = 4163. Define Hawk as g; S = l + V = 4163 + 1901 = 6064; so g = 866 + S = 866 + 6064 = 6930. Define Penguin as D; so D = g + I = 6930 + 672 = 7602. Answer: 7602.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 482.
- The number of Crow equals 375 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 653 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Owl.
- The number of Penguin equals 739 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 146 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 3 plus the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Crow = 375 + (Parrot + Owl)
- The number of Parrot = 653 + (Hawk + Blue Jay)
- The number of Blue Jay = Owl
- The number of Penguin = 739 + Crow
- The number of Sparrow = 146 + Eagle
- The number of Hawk = Blue Jay + Sparrow + Owl
- The number of Owl = 3 + Sparrow

Substituting the number of Owl from the last equation into the previous equations, we get:

- The number of Crow = 375 + (653 + Hawk + 3 + Sparrow)
- The number of Parrot = 653 + (Hawk + 3 + Sparrow)
- The number of Penguin = 739 + (375 + Hawk + Sparrow)
- The number of Sparrow = 146 + 482

Solving these equations, we get:

- The number of Crow = 1020
- The number of Parrot = 1020
- The number of Penguin = 1464
- The number of Sparrow = 626

**Answer: 1464**<eos>
Define Eagle as E; so E = 482. Define Sparrow as L; n = E = 482; so L = 146 + n = 146 + 482 = 628. Define Owl as w; v = L = 628; so w = 3 + v = 3 + 628 = 631. Define Blue Jay as j; so j = w = 631. Define Hawk as g; r = j + L = 631 + 628 = 1259; so g = r + w = 1259 + 631 = 1890. Define Parrot as e; D = g + j = 1890 + 631 = 2521; so e = 653 + D = 653 + 2521 = 3174. Define Crow as p; u = e + w = 3174 + 631 = 3805; so p = 375 + u = 375 + 3805 = 4180. Define Penguin as A; z = p = 4180; so A = 739 + z = 739 + 4180 = 4919. Answer: 4919.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 482.
- the number of crow equals 375 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of owl.
- the number of parrot equals 653 plus the sum of the number of hawk and the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals the number of owl.
- the number of penguin equals 739 plus the number of crow.
- the number of sparrow equals 146 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of hawk equals the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of sparrow, and the number of owl.
- the number of owl equals 3 plus the number of sparrow.

**calculation:**

- the number of crow = 375 + (parrot + owl)
- the number of parrot = 653 + (hawk + blue jay)
- the number of blue jay = owl
- the number of penguin = 739 + crow
- the number of sparrow = 146 + eagle
- the number of hawk = blue jay + sparrow + owl
- the number of owl = 3 + sparrow

substituting the number of owl from the last equation into the previous equations, we get:

- the number of crow = 375 + (653 + hawk + 3 + sparrow)
- the number of parrot = 653 + (hawk + 3 + sparrow)
- the number of penguin = 739 + (375 + hawk + sparrow)
- the number of sparrow = 146 + 482

solving these equations, we get:

- the number of crow = 1020
- the number of parrot = 1020
- the number of penguin = 1464
- the number of sparrow = 626

- The number of Crow is 248 plus the number of Blue Jay, so the number of Crow is 248 + 590 = 838.
- The number of Penguin is 297 plus the number of Crow, so the number of Penguin is 297 + 838 = 1135.
- The number of Owl is the sum of the number of Penguin, the number of Crow, and the number of Blue Jay, so the number of Owl is 1135 + 838 + 590 = 2563.
- The number of Hawk is the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Sparrow, the number of Penguin, and the number of Owl, so the number of Hawk is unknown + 501 + 1135 + 2563 = unknown.

**Answer: Unknown**<eos>
Define Sparrow as J; so J = 501. Define Eagle as n; O = J = 501; so n = 590 + O = 590 + 501 = 1091. Define Blue Jay as b; so b = n = 1091. Define Crow as e; k = b = 1091; so e = 248 + k = 248 + 1091 = 1339. Define Penguin as W; P = e = 1339; so W = 297 + P = 297 + 1339 = 1636. Define Owl as o; a = W + e = 1636 + 1339 = 2975; so o = a + b = 2975 + 1091 = 4066. Define Parrot as I; so I = o = 4066. Define Hawk as X; j = I + J = 4066 + 501 = 4567; M = j + W = 4567 + 1636 = 6203; so X = M + o = 6203 + 4066 = 10269. Answer: 10269.

- The number of Fox equals the sum of 278 + 58 + 176 = 512.

**Answer: 512**<eos>
Define Tiger as e; so e = 58. Define Elephant as E; Z = e = 58; so E = 118 + Z = 118 + 58 = 176. Define Wolf as n; so n = E + e = 176 + 58 = 234. Define Deer as V; R = n = 234; so V = 432 + R = 432 + 234 = 666. Define Raccoon as p; K = V + e = 666 + 58 = 724; Y = K + E = 724 + 176 = 900; so p = Y + n = 900 + 234 = 1134. Define Bear as c; t = p = 1134; so c = 278 + t = 278 + 1134 = 1412. Define Lion as J; W = c + e = 1412 + 58 = 1470; so J = W + n = 1470 + 234 = 1704.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 604 plus the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Crow, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Owl, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 941.
- The number of Hawk equals 847 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 179 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot equals 407 plus the number of Crow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Eagle = 604 + (Owl + Crow + Sparrow) = 604 + (x + y + 941) = 1545 + x + y
- The number of Blue Jay = Eagle + Owl + Crow = 1545 + x + y + x + y = 2(x + y) + 1545
- The number of Hawk = 847 + Blue Jay = 847 + 2(x + y) + 1545 = 2492 + 2x + 2y
- Therefore, the number of Hawk is 2492 + 2x + 2y.

**Answer: 2492 + 2x + 2y**<eos>
Define Sparrow as Q; so Q = 941. Define Crow as k; N = Q = 941; so k = 179 + N = 179 + 941 = 1120. Define Parrot as r; A = k = 1120; so r = 407 + A = 407 + 1120 = 1527. Define Owl as y; x = r + Q = 1527 + 941 = 2468; so y = x + k = 2468 + 1120 = 3588. Define Eagle as p; S = y + k = 3588 + 1120 = 4708; g = S + Q = 4708 + 941 = 5649; so p = 604 + g = 604 + 5649 = 6253. Define Blue Jay as U; H = p + y = 6253 + 3588 = 9841; so U = H + k = 9841 + 1120 = 10961. Define Hawk as z; o = U = 10961; so z = 847 + o = 847 + 10961 = 11808. Answer: 11808.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 604 plus the sum of the number of owl, the number of crow, and the number of sparrow.
- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of eagle, the number of owl, and the number of crow.
- the number of sparrow equals 941.
- the number of hawk equals 847 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of parrot, the number of sparrow, and the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals 179 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of parrot equals 407 plus the number of crow.

**calculation:**

- the number of eagle = 604 + (owl + crow + sparrow) = 604 + (x + y + 941) = 1545 + x + y
- the number of blue jay = eagle + owl + crow = 1545 + x + y + x + y = 2(x + y) + 1545
- the number of hawk = 847 + blue jay = 847 + 2(x + y) + 1545 = 2492 + 2x + 2y
- therefore, the number of hawk is 2492 + 2x + 2y.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Penguin equals 836 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 834 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Crow = the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Blue Jay.
= the sum of 0, 258, and 834
= 1092
- The number of Penguin = 836 + the number of Crow
= 836 + 1092
= 1928

**Answer: 1928**<eos>
Define Sparrow as v; so v = 258. Define Parrot as G; R = v = 258; so G = 97 + R = 97 + 258 = 355. Define Blue Jay as m; u = G + v = 355 + 258 = 613; so m = 834 + u = 834 + 613 = 1447. Define Hawk as A; I = m + v = 1447 + 258 = 1705; so A = I + G = 1705 + 355 = 2060. Define Owl as g; s = A = 2060; so g = 90 + s = 90 + 2060 = 2150. Define Eagle as t; so t = g = 2150. Define Crow as D; H = t + v = 2150 + 258 = 2408; so D = H + m = 2408 + 1447 = 3855. Define Penguin as W; S = D = 3855; so W = 836 + S = 836 + 3855 = 4691. Answer: 4691.
**arguments:**

- the number of penguin equals 836 plus the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of eagle, the number of sparrow, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals 834 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of sparrow.

**calculation:**

- the number of crow = the sum of the number of eagle, the number of sparrow, and the number of blue jay.
= the sum of 0, 258, and 834
= 1092
- the number of penguin = 836 + the number of crow
= 836 + 1092
= 1928

- The number of Hawk equals 891 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 171 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Parrot, and the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Eagle is 289 + (Owl + Parrot) = 289 + (33 + 146) = 289 + 179 = 468.
- The number of Blue Jay is 919 + (Eagle + Parrot + Owl) = 919 + (468 + 146 + 33) = 919 + 647 = 1566.
- The number of Sparrow is (Blue Jay + Parrot + Owl) = 1566 + 146 + 33 = 1745.
- The number of Hawk is 891 + Crow = 891 + (171 + Sparrow) = 891 + (171 + 1745) = 891 + 1916 = 2807.

**Answer: 2807**<eos>
Define Parrot as I; so I = 146. Define Owl as d; B = I = 146; so d = 33 + B = 33 + 146 = 179. Define Eagle as Z; E = d + I = 179 + 146 = 325; so Z = 289 + E = 289 + 325 = 614. Define Blue Jay as M; y = Z + I = 614 + 146 = 760; h = y + d = 760 + 179 = 939; so M = 919 + h = 919 + 939 = 1858. Define Sparrow as R; i = M + I = 1858 + 146 = 2004; so R = i + d = 2004 + 179 = 2183. Define Crow as s; O = R = 2183; so s = 171 + O = 171 + 2183 = 2354. Define Hawk as Q; e = s = 2354; so Q = 891 + e = 891 + 2354 = 3245. Answer: 3245.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 547 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals 36 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Elephant, the number of Deer, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 771 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Raccoon equals 7.
- The number of Deer equals 602 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Bear, and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the number of Bear:**
Number of Bear = 547 + (Number of Deer + Number of Raccoon)
Number of Bear = 547 + (602 + 7)
Number of Bear = 1156

2. **Calculate the number of Elephant:**
Number of Elephant = 36 + Number of Bear
Number of Elephant = 36 + 1156
Number of Elephant = 1192

3. **Calculate the number of Wolf:**
Number of Wolf = 771 + Number of Elephant
Number of Wolf = 771 + 1192
Number of Wolf = 1963

4. **Calculate the number of Fox:**
Number of Fox = Number of Wolf + Number of Elephant + Number of Deer + Number of Bear
Number of Fox = 1963 + 1192 + 602 + 1156
Number of Fox = 4903

5. **Calculate the number of Tiger:**
Number of Tiger = Number of Fox + Number of Bear + Number of Deer
Number of Tiger = 4903 + 1156 + 602
Number of Tiger = 6651

**Answer: 6651**<eos>
Define Raccoon as s; so s = 7. Define Deer as X; R = s = 7; so X = 602 + R = 602 + 7 = 609. Define Bear as q; E = X + s = 609 + 7 = 616; so q = 547 + E = 547 + 616 = 1163. Define Elephant as f; n = q = 1163; so f = 36 + n = 36 + 1163 = 1199. Define Wolf as e; v = f = 1199; so e = 771 + v = 771 + 1199 = 1970. Define Fox as u; a = e + f = 1970 + 1199 = 3169; x = a + X = 3169 + 609 = 3778; so u = x + q = 3778 + 1163 = 4941. Define Tiger as G; i = u + q = 4941 + 1163 = 6104; so G = i + X = 6104 + 609 = 6713. Answer: 6713.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Penguin equals the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 65 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 937.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Peacock equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Eagle, and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Penguin.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 197 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Eagle equals 294 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Crow equals 471 plus the number of Peacock.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Penguin equals the number of Blue Jay. Therefore, the number of Blue Jay is also the number of Penguin.
- The number of Owl equals 65 plus the number of Crow. We don't have information about the number of Crow, so we cannot calculate the number of Owl.

**Answer: Cannot be determined**<eos>
Define Sparrow as w; so w = 937. Define Eagle as I; F = w = 937; so I = 294 + F = 294 + 937 = 1231. Define Blue Jay as X; S = I + w = 1231 + 937 = 2168; so X = 197 + S = 197 + 2168 = 2365. Define Penguin as z; so z = X = 2365. Define Hawk as t; so t = z + w = 2365 + 937 = 3302. Define Parrot as W; so W = t + z = 3302 + 2365 = 5667. Define Peacock as A; m = W + I = 5667 + 1231 = 6898; so A = m + t = 6898 + 3302 = 10200. Define Crow as h; y = A = 10200; so h = 471 + y = 471 + 10200 = 10671. Define Owl as Y; G = h = 10671; so Y = 65 + G = 65 + 10671 = 10736. Answer: 10736.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Horse equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Wolf, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals the number of Horse.
- The number of Tiger equals 564 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Lion, the number of Fox, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 977 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 556.
- The number of Lion equals 672 plus the number of Tiger.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Horse equals the number of Wolf. Therefore, let's assume both are x.
- The number of Raccoon is x + Deer + Wolf + Bear.
- The number of Bear is x.
- The number of Tiger is 564 + Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant is Lion + Fox + Bear.
- The number of Deer is 977 + Bear.
- The number of Wolf is Fox.
- The number of Fox is 556.
- The number of Lion is 672 + Tiger.

- Substituting the values we know into the equations, we get:
x = Wolf = Horse
x + Deer + Wolf + Bear = Raccoon
Bear = x
564 + Raccoon = Tiger
Lion + Fox + Bear = Elephant
977 + Bear = Deer
Fox = Wolf
556 = Fox

- Solving for the unknowns, we get:
x = Wolf = Horse = 556
Bear = x = 556
Raccoon = x + Deer + Wolf + Bear = 556 + Deer + 556 + 556 = 1668
Tiger = 564 + Raccoon = 564 + 1668 = 2232
Elephant = Lion + Fox + Bear = 672 + 556 + 556 = 1784

**Answer: 1784**<eos>
Define Fox as e; so e = 556. Define Wolf as X; so X = e = 556. Define Horse as p; so p = X = 556. Define Bear as g; so g = p = 556. Define Deer as v; I = g = 556; so v = 977 + I = 977 + 556 = 1533. Define Raccoon as P; m = v + X = 1533 + 556 = 2089; so P = m + g = 2089 + 556 = 2645. Define Tiger as D; w = P = 2645; so D = 564 + w = 564 + 2645 = 3209. Define Lion as t; i = D = 3209; so t = 672 + i = 672 + 3209 = 3881. Define Elephant as T; S = t + e = 3881 + 556 = 4437; so T = S + g = 4437 + 556 = 4993. Answer: 4993.
**arguments:**

- the number of horse equals the number of wolf.
- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of deer, the number of wolf, and the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals the number of horse.

- the number of elephant equals the sum of the number of lion, the number of fox, and the number of bear.
- the number of deer equals 977 plus the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 556.
- the number of lion equals 672 plus the number of tiger.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we know that the number of horse equals the number of wolf. therefore, let's assume both are x.
- the number of raccoon is x + deer + wolf + bear.
- the number of bear is x.
- the number of tiger is 564 + raccoon.
- the number of elephant is lion + fox + bear.
- the number of deer is 977 + bear.
- the number of wolf is fox.
- the number of fox is 556.
- the number of lion is 672 + tiger.

- substituting the values we know into the equations, we get:
x = wolf = horse
x + deer + wolf + bear = raccoon
bear = x
564 + raccoon = tiger
lion + fox + bear = elephant
977 + bear = deer
fox = wolf
556 = fox

- solving for the unknowns, we get:
x = wolf = horse = 556
bear = x = 556
raccoon = x + deer + wolf + bear = 556 + deer + 556 + 556 = 1668
tiger = 564 + raccoon = 564 + 1668 = 2232
elephant = lion + fox + bear = 672 + 556 + 556 = 1784

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 758 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 723 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 402 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Sparrow equals 170 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Hawk equals 636 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Parrot, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Owl = 723 + Hawk's number
- The number of Sparrow = 170 + Blue Jay's number + Parrot's number
- The number of Eagle = Crow's number + Owl's number + Sparrow's number
- The number of Eagle = 758 + 723 + Hawk's number + 170 + Blue Jay's number + Parrot's number

**Answer: Eagle = 1641 + Hawk's number + Blue Jay's number + Parrot's number**<eos>
Define Parrot as n; so n = 270. Define Blue Jay as U; V = n = 270; so U = 402 + V = 402 + 270 = 672. Define Sparrow as S; c = U + n = 672 + 270 = 942; so S = 170 + c = 170 + 942 = 1112. Define Hawk as t; H = S + n = 1112 + 270 = 1382; s = H + U = 1382 + 672 = 2054; so t = 636 + s = 636 + 2054 = 2690. Define Owl as K; R = t = 2690; so K = 723 + R = 723 + 2690 = 3413. Define Crow as P; w = K = 3413; so P = 758 + w = 758 + 3413 = 4171. Define Eagle as d; Q = P + K = 4171 + 3413 = 7584; so d = Q + S = 7584 + 1112 = 8696. Answer: 8696.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question!

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 117 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals 74 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Tiger equals the number of Elephant.
- The number of Bear equals 766 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 547 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Lion equals 76 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals 809.
- The number of Raccoon equals 242 plus the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Elephant = 117 + (Wolf + Deer) = 117 + (547 + 809) = 117 + 1356 = 1473.
- The number of Tiger = Elephant = 1473.
- The number of Fox = 74 + (Tiger + Elephant) = 74 + (1473 + 1473) = 74 + 2946 = 3020.
- The number of Bear = 766 + (Fox + Wolf) = 766 + (3020 + 547) = 766 + 3567 = 4333.
- The number of Wolf = 547 + Deer = 547 + 809 = 1356.
- The number of Lion = 76 + Raccoon = 76 + (242 + Bear) = 76 + (242 + 4333) = 76 + 4575 = 4651.

**Answer: 4651**<eos>
Define Deer as x; so x = 809. Define Wolf as p; n = x = 809; so p = 547 + n = 547 + 809 = 1356. Define Elephant as K; J = p + x = 1356 + 809 = 2165; so K = 117 + J = 117 + 2165 = 2282. Define Tiger as d; so d = K = 2282. Define Fox as B; m = d + K = 2282 + 2282 = 4564; so B = 74 + m = 74 + 4564 = 4638. Define Bear as f; y = B + p = 4638 + 1356 = 5994; so f = 766 + y = 766 + 5994 = 6760. Define Raccoon as j; D = f = 6760; so j = 242 + D = 242 + 6760 = 7002. Define Lion as a; g = j = 7002; so a = 76 + g = 76 + 7002 = 7078. Answer: 7078.
**arguments:**

- the number of elephant equals 117 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of deer.
- the number of fox equals 74 plus the sum of the number of tiger and the number of elephant.
- the number of tiger equals the number of elephant.
- the number of bear equals 766 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 547 plus the number of deer.
- the number of lion equals 76 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of deer equals 809.
- the number of raccoon equals 242 plus the number of bear.

**calculation:**

- the number of elephant = 117 + (wolf + deer) = 117 + (547 + 809) = 117 + 1356 = 1473.
- the number of tiger = elephant = 1473.
- the number of fox = 74 + (tiger + elephant) = 74 + (1473 + 1473) = 74 + 2946 = 3020.
- the number of bear = 766 + (fox + wolf) = 766 + (3020 + 547) = 766 + 3567 = 4333.
- the number of wolf = 547 + deer = 547 + 809 = 1356.
- the number of lion = 76 + raccoon = 76 + (242 + bear) = 76 + (242 + 4333) = 76 + 4575 = 4651.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 167 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 77.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Elephant, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Tiger equals 813 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 932 plus the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Bear, and the number of Lion.
- The number of Lion equals the number of Bear.
- The number of Deer equals 908 plus the number of Lion.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Elephant as 167 + Deer.
- The number of Raccoon is equal to the sum of Tiger, Elephant, and Bear, which can be expressed as Tiger + Elephant + Bear.
- The number of Fox is equal to 932 + the sum of Elephant, Bear, and Lion.
- The number of Lion is equal to the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf is equal to the sum of Raccoon and Fox, which can be expressed as Raccoon + Fox.

**Answer:**

**Answer: Wolf = Raccoon + Fox**
**Wolf = (Tiger + Elephant + Bear) + (932 + Elephant + Bear + Lion)**<eos>
Define Bear as o; so o = 77. Define Lion as F; so F = o = 77. Define Deer as N; Y = F = 77; so N = 908 + Y = 908 + 77 = 985. Define Elephant as V; h = N = 985; so V = 167 + h = 167 + 985 = 1152. Define Fox as n; J = V + o = 1152 + 77 = 1229; S = J + F = 1229 + 77 = 1306; so n = 932 + S = 932 + 1306 = 2238. Define Tiger as H; c = n = 2238; so H = 813 + c = 813 + 2238 = 3051. Define Raccoon as f; P = H + V = 3051 + 1152 = 4203; so f = P + o = 4203 + 77 = 4280. Define Wolf as a; so a = f + n = 4280 + 2238 = 6518. Answer: 6518.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 57 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Penguin equals 382.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Parrot, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals 856 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 251 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Penguin, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 758 plus the number of Penguin.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Crow = 57 + (Parrot + Eagle)
- The number of Sparrow = Crow + Parrot + Eagle
- The number of Hawk = Blue Jay
- The number of Blue Jay = Sparrow + Penguin + Owl
- The number of Owl = 758 + Penguin

Substituting the number of Penguin from the last equation into the equation before it, we get:

- The number of Blue Jay = Sparrow + (758 + Penguin) + Owl
- The number of Hawk = Blue Jay

Substituting the number of Blue Jay from the previous equation into the equation for Hawk, we get:

- The number of Hawk = (Sparrow + (758 + Penguin) + Owl)

**Answer: The number of Hawk is (Sparrow + (758 + Penguin) + Owl)**<eos>
Define Penguin as t; so t = 382. Define Owl as E; o = t = 382; so E = 758 + o = 758 + 382 = 1140. Define Eagle as Q; y = E = 1140; so Q = 251 + y = 251 + 1140 = 1391. Define Parrot as B; R = Q = 1391; so B = 856 + R = 856 + 1391 = 2247. Define Crow as G; c = B + Q = 2247 + 1391 = 3638; so G = 57 + c = 57 + 3638 = 3695. Define Sparrow as g; w = G + B = 3695 + 2247 = 5942; so g = w + Q = 5942 + 1391 = 7333. Define Blue Jay as l; r = g + t = 7333 + 382 = 7715; so l = r + E = 7715 + 1140 = 8855. Define Hawk as V; so V = l = 8855. Answer: 8855.
**arguments:**

- the number of crow equals 57 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of eagle.
- the number of penguin equals 382.
- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of crow, the number of parrot, and the number of eagle.
- the number of hawk equals the number of blue jay.
- the number of parrot equals 856 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 251 plus the number of owl.
- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of sparrow, the number of penguin, and the number of owl.

**calculation:**

- the number of crow = 57 + (parrot + eagle)
- the number of sparrow = crow + parrot + eagle
- the number of hawk = blue jay
- the number of blue jay = sparrow + penguin + owl
- the number of owl = 758 + penguin

substituting the number of penguin from the last equation into the equation before it, we get:

- the number of blue jay = sparrow + (758 + penguin) + owl
- the number of hawk = blue jay

substituting the number of blue jay from the previous equation into the equation for hawk, we get:

- the number of hawk = (sparrow + (758 + penguin) + owl)

  Sparrow = 385 + 111
  Sparrow = 496

- The number of Peacock is:
  Peacock = 51 + Sparrow
  Peacock = 51 + 496
  Peacock = 547

**Answer: 547**<eos>
Define Crow as U; so U = 740. Define Eagle as R; so R = U = 740. Define Owl as Y; K = R = 740; so Y = 839 + K = 839 + 740 = 1579. Define Penguin as M; V = Y + R = 1579 + 740 = 2319; so M = 111 + V = 111 + 2319 = 2430. Define Hawk as z; x = M + Y = 2430 + 1579 = 4009; f = x + R = 4009 + 740 = 4749; so z = f + U = 4749 + 740 = 5489. Define Blue Jay as W; N = z = 5489; so W = 385 + N = 385 + 5489 = 5874. Define Sparrow as A; so A = W + M = 5874 + 2430 = 8304. Define Peacock as u; L = A = 8304; so u = 51 + L = 51 + 8304 = 8355. Answer: 8355.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 830 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk equals 847 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Owl, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 343 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Owl, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 102.
- The number of Owl equals 568 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Sparrow:
Number of Sparrow = Number of Hawk + Number of Owl + Number of Eagle
Number of Sparrow = (847 + 568) + 102
Number of Sparrow = 1415

- We can then calculate the number of Parrot:
Number of Parrot = Number of Sparrow - Number of Sparrow
Number of Parrot = 1415 - 102
Number of Parrot = 1313

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Crow:
Number of Crow = Number of Parrot + Number of Owl + Number of Sparrow + Number of Blue Jay
Number of Crow = 1313 + 568 + 1415 + 102
Number of Crow = 3498

**Answer: 3498**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as z; so z = 102. Define Eagle as n; O = z = 102; so n = 343 + O = 343 + 102 = 445. Define Owl as R; m = n + z = 445 + 102 = 547; so R = 568 + m = 568 + 547 = 1115. Define Hawk as A; d = R = 1115; so A = 847 + d = 847 + 1115 = 1962. Define Sparrow as E; k = A + R = 1962 + 1115 = 3077; so E = k + n = 3077 + 445 = 3522. Define Parrot as U; u = E = 3522; so U = 830 + u = 830 + 3522 = 4352. Define Crow as L; q = U + R = 4352 + 1115 = 5467; a = q + E = 5467 + 3522 = 8989; so L = a + z = 8989 + 102 = 9091. Answer: 9091.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 830 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of hawk equals 847 plus the number of owl.
- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of hawk, the number of owl, and the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 343 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of parrot, the number of owl, the number of sparrow, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals 102.
- the number of owl equals 568 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of blue jay.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of sparrow:
number of sparrow = number of hawk + number of owl + number of eagle
number of sparrow = (847 + 568) + 102
number of sparrow = 1415

- we can then calculate the number of parrot:
number of parrot = number of sparrow - number of sparrow
number of parrot = 1415 - 102
number of parrot = 1313

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of crow:
number of crow = number of parrot + number of owl + number of sparrow + number of blue jay
number of crow = 1313 + 568 + 1415 + 102
number of crow = 3498

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question!

- The number of Wolf equals 26.
- The number of Bear equals 376 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Lion equals 785 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Lion equals 785 plus the number of Wolf = 785 + 26 = 811.
- The number of Fox equals 633 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Tiger = 633 + (801 + 246) = 1680.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Lion = 1680 + 811 = 2491.

**Answer: 2491**<eos>
Define Wolf as V; so V = 26. Define Lion as i; I = V = 26; so i = 785 + I = 785 + 26 = 811. Define Tiger as W; y = i + V = 811 + 26 = 837; so W = 246 + y = 246 + 837 = 1083. Define Elephant as Z; q = W = 1083; so Z = 735 + q = 735 + 1083 = 1818. Define Bear as O; E = Z + W = 1818 + 1083 = 2901; so O = 376 + E = 376 + 2901 = 3277. Define Deer as L; G = O = 3277; so L = 801 + G = 801 + 3277 = 4078. Define Fox as Y; z = L + W = 4078 + 1083 = 5161; so Y = 633 + z = 633 + 5161 = 5794. Define Raccoon as u; so u = Y + i = 5794 + 811 = 6605. Answer: 6605.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals 824 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Elephant, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals 844 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 927 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals 334 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Deer equals 520 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Bear equals 591 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Wolf equals 251.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger = 824 + Fox + Elephant + Wolf = 824 + 927 + 844 + 251 = 2846.
- The number of Deer = 520 + Tiger = 520 + 2846 = 3366.

**Answer: 3366**<eos>
Define Wolf as Q; so Q = 251. Define Elephant as W; S = Q = 251; so W = 844 + S = 844 + 251 = 1095. Define Raccoon as g; w = W + Q = 1095 + 251 = 1346; so g = 334 + w = 334 + 1346 = 1680. Define Bear as p; A = g = 1680; so p = 591 + A = 591 + 1680 = 2271. Define Fox as V; n = p + Q = 2271 + 251 = 2522; so V = 927 + n = 927 + 2522 = 3449. Define Tiger as t; c = V + W = 3449 + 1095 = 4544; b = c + Q = 4544 + 251 = 4795; so t = 824 + b = 824 + 4795 = 5619. Define Deer as E; R = t = 5619; so E = 520 + R = 520 + 5619 = 6139. Answer: 6139.

- The number of Blue Jay is 14 plus the number of Owl:
Number of Blue Jay = 14 + 791 = 805

- The number of Hawk is 391 plus the number of Crow:
Number of Hawk = 391 + (Number of Parrot + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Owl)
= 391 + (Number of Parrot + 805 + 791)
= 391 + (Number of Parrot + 1596)

- The number of Sparrow is the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Owl:
Number of Sparrow = Number of Eagle + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Owl
= 728 + 805 + 791

- The number of Parrot is equal to the number of Sparrow:
Number of Parrot = Number of Sparrow = 728 + 805 + 791 = 2324

- The number of Crow is 851 plus the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Owl:

= 851 + (2324 + 805 + 791)
= 851 + 3920
= 4771

**Answer: 4771**<eos>
Define Penguin as e; so e = 791. Define Owl as f; so f = e = 791. Define Blue Jay as i; s = f = 791; so i = 14 + s = 14 + 791 = 805. Define Eagle as j; X = i = 805; so j = 728 + X = 728 + 805 = 1533. Define Sparrow as u; L = j + i = 1533 + 805 = 2338; so u = L + f = 2338 + 791 = 3129. Define Parrot as I; so I = u = 3129. Define Crow as r; N = I + i = 3129 + 805 = 3934; O = N + f = 3934 + 791 = 4725; so r = 851 + O = 851 + 4725 = 5576. Define Hawk as Q; g = r = 5576; so Q = 391 + g = 391 + 5576 = 5967. Answer: 5967.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Horse equals the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Lion, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 361 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Lion equals 224 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 665 plus the number of Horse.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Raccoon equals 592.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Fox as:
Number of Fox = Number of Deer + Number of Raccoon = 361 + 592 = 953
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Fox, so the number of Wolf is 953.
- The number of Lion equals 224 plus the number of Wolf, so the number of Lion is 224 + 953 = 1177.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Lion, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Deer, so the number of Elephant is 1177 + 592 + 361 = 2130.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Deer, so the number of Tiger is 2130 + 592 + 361 = 3083.
- The number of Bear equals 665 plus the number of Horse, so the number of Bear is 665 + (Number of Horse) = 665 + (Number of Tiger - Number of Elephant) = 665 + (3083 - 2130) = 665 + 953 = 1618.

**Answer: 1618**<eos>
Define Raccoon as I; so I = 592. Define Deer as D; m = I = 592; so D = 361 + m = 361 + 592 = 953. Define Fox as W; so W = D + I = 953 + 592 = 1545. Define Wolf as c; so c = W = 1545. Define Lion as x; y = c = 1545; so x = 224 + y = 224 + 1545 = 1769. Define Elephant as a; T = x + I = 1769 + 592 = 2361; so a = T + D = 2361 + 953 = 3314. Define Tiger as n; j = a + I = 3314 + 592 = 3906; so n = j + D = 3906 + 953 = 4859. Define Horse as R; so R = n + a = 4859 + 3314 = 8173. Define Bear as X; L = R = 8173; so X = 665 + L = 665 + 8173 = 8838. Answer: 8838.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals the sum of the number of deer and the number of raccoon.
- the number of horse equals the sum of the number of tiger and the number of elephant.
- the number of elephant equals the sum of the number of lion, the number of raccoon, and the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 361 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of lion equals 224 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals the number of fox.
- the number of bear equals 665 plus the number of horse.
- the number of tiger equals the sum of the number of elephant, the number of raccoon, and the number of deer.
- the number of raccoon equals 592.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of fox as:
number of fox = number of deer + number of raccoon = 361 + 592 = 953
- the number of wolf equals the number of fox, so the number of wolf is 953.
- the number of lion equals 224 plus the number of wolf, so the number of lion is 224 + 953 = 1177.
- the number of elephant equals the sum of the number of lion, the number of raccoon, and the number of deer, so the number of elephant is 1177 + 592 + 361 = 2130.
- the number of tiger equals the sum of the number of elephant, the number of raccoon, and the number of deer, so the number of tiger is 2130 + 592 + 361 = 3083.
- the number of bear equals 665 plus the number of horse, so the number of bear is 665 + (number of horse) = 665 + (number of tiger - number of elephant) = 665 + (3083 - 2130) = 665 + 953 = 1618.

- The number of Eagle = Hawk + Crow = 1627 + 752 = 2379.
- The number of Parrot = 45 + Eagle + Hawk = 45 + 2379 + 1627 = 4431.
- The number of Penguin = 334 + Blue Jay = 334 + 258 = 592.

**Answer: 592**<eos>
Define Owl as M; so M = 460. Define Sparrow as i; D = M = 460; so i = 415 + D = 415 + 460 = 875. Define Crow as T; I = i + M = 875 + 460 = 1335; so T = 752 + I = 752 + 1335 = 2087. Define Hawk as w; L = T + M = 2087 + 460 = 2547; so w = L + i = 2547 + 875 = 3422. Define Eagle as H; so H = w + T = 3422 + 2087 = 5509. Define Parrot as b; G = H + w = 5509 + 3422 = 8931; so b = 45 + G = 45 + 8931 = 8976. Define Blue Jay as B; S = b = 8976; so B = 258 + S = 258 + 8976 = 9234. Define Penguin as Y; z = B = 9234; so Y = 334 + z = 334 + 9234 = 9568. Answer: 9568.

- The number of Parrot is 180 + 1226 = 1406.
- The number of Sparrow is 443 + 1406 = 1849.

**Answer: 1849**<eos>
Define Owl as W; so W = 421. Define Crow as T; G = W = 421; so T = 690 + G = 690 + 421 = 1111. Define Eagle as Y; y = T + W = 1111 + 421 = 1532; so Y = 313 + y = 313 + 1532 = 1845. Define Blue Jay as Z; P = Y + W = 1845 + 421 = 2266; M = P + T = 2266 + 1111 = 3377; so Z = 453 + M = 453 + 3377 = 3830. Define Hawk as z; I = Z = 3830; so z = 773 + I = 773 + 3830 = 4603. Define Parrot as D; X = z = 4603; so D = 180 + X = 180 + 4603 = 4783. Define Sparrow as j; c = D + z = 4783 + 4603 = 9386; so j = 443 + c = 443 + 9386 = 9829. Answer: 9829.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 177 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon equals 419 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Deer.
- The number of Fox equals 997 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Tiger equals 593 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 419 plus the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Bear, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 790.
- The number of Deer equals 45 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Fox:
Number of Fox = 997 + Number of Bear = 997 + 790 = 1787
- We can also calculate the number of Elephant:
Number of Elephant = 177 + Number of Fox = 177 + 1787 = 1964
- From the equation for the number of Raccoon, we can solve for the number of Raccoon:
Number of Raccoon = 419 + Number of Tiger + Number of Deer
- We can calculate the number of Tiger:
Number of Tiger = 593 + Number of Deer = 593 + (45 + Number of Wolf) = 593 + 45 + 1787 = 2325
- Substituting the values of Number of Elephant, Number of Fox, and Number of Tiger into the equation for the number of Raccoon, we get:
Number of Raccoon = 419 + 2325 + 45 + Number of Wolf = 2789 + Number of Wolf
- Therefore, the number of Raccoon is 2789 + Number of Wolf.

**Answer: 2789 + Number of Wolf**<eos>
Define Bear as u; so u = 790. Define Fox as s; X = u = 790; so s = 997 + X = 997 + 790 = 1787. Define Elephant as l; g = s = 1787; so l = 177 + g = 177 + 1787 = 1964. Define Wolf as M; f = l + u = 1964 + 790 = 2754; P = f + s = 2754 + 1787 = 4541; so M = 419 + P = 419 + 4541 = 4960. Define Deer as Q; d = M = 4960; so Q = 45 + d = 45 + 4960 = 5005. Define Tiger as A; G = Q + M = 5005 + 4960 = 9965; so A = 593 + G = 593 + 9965 = 10558. Define Raccoon as B; R = A + Q = 10558 + 5005 = 15563; so B = 419 + R = 419 + 15563 = 15982. Answer: 15982.
**arguments:**

- the number of elephant equals 177 plus the number of fox.
- the number of raccoon equals 419 plus the sum of the number of tiger and the number of deer.
- the number of fox equals 997 plus the number of bear.
- the number of tiger equals 593 plus the sum of the number of deer and the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 419 plus the sum of the number of elephant, the number of bear, and the number of fox.
- the number of bear equals 790.
- the number of deer equals 45 plus the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of fox:
number of fox = 997 + number of bear = 997 + 790 = 1787
- we can also calculate the number of elephant:
number of elephant = 177 + number of fox = 177 + 1787 = 1964
- from the equation for the number of raccoon, we can solve for the number of raccoon:
number of raccoon = 419 + number of tiger + number of deer
- we can calculate the number of tiger:
number of tiger = 593 + number of deer = 593 + (45 + number of wolf) = 593 + 45 + 1787 = 2325
- substituting the values of number of elephant, number of fox, and number of tiger into the equation for the number of raccoon, we get:
number of raccoon = 419 + 2325 + 45 + number of wolf = 2789 + number of wolf
- therefore, the number of raccoon is 2789 + number of wolf.

Define Sparrow as O; so O = 208. Define Blue Jay as q; m = O = 208; so q = 766 + m = 766 + 208 = 974. Define Parrot as p; B = q + O = 974 + 208 = 1182; so p = 480 + B = 480 + 1182 = 1662. Define Eagle as V; H = p + O = 1662 + 208 = 1870; so V = 116 + H = 116 + 1870 = 1986. Define Hawk as F; f = V = 1986; so F = 333 + f = 333 + 1986 = 2319. Define Crow as Q; X = F = 2319; so Q = 295 + X = 295 + 2319 = 2614. Define Owl as C; S = Q + p = 2614 + 1662 = 4276; h = S + O = 4276 + 208 = 4484; so C = h + V = 4484 + 1986 = 6470. Answer: 6470.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of crow, the number of parrot, the number of sparrow, and the number of eagle.
- the number of blue jay equals 766 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of parrot equals 480 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of sparrow.
- the number of crow equals 295 plus the number of hawk.
- the number of sparrow equals 208.
- the number of eagle equals 116 plus the sum of the number of parrot and the number of sparrow.
- the number of hawk equals 333 plus the number of eagle.

**calculation:**

1. **calculate the number of owl:**
   - owl = crow + parrot + sparrow + eagle
   - owl = 295 + (480 + 766 + 208) + 208
   - owl = 295 + 1420 + 208
   - **owl = 1913**

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated. Problem: The number of Deer equals 535 plus the number of Raccoon.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals 535 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals 292 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 795 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Tiger equals 521 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 710 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals 434 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 871.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Deer = 535 + 871 = 1406.
- The number of Bear = 292 + (795 + 871) = 292 + 1666 = 1958.
- The number of Fox = 795 + 871 = 1666.
- The number of Tiger = 521 + 1958 = 2479.
- The number of Wolf = 710 + 1406 = 2116.
- The number of Elephant = 434 + (2479 + 871) = 434 + 3350 = 3784.

**Answer: 3784**<eos>
Define Raccoon as U; so U = 871. Define Deer as A; Y = U = 871; so A = 535 + Y = 535 + 871 = 1406. Define Wolf as K; f = A + U = 1406 + 871 = 2277; so K = 710 + f = 710 + 2277 = 2987. Define Fox as p; u = K = 2987; so p = 795 + u = 795 + 2987 = 3782. Define Bear as H; t = p + U = 3782 + 871 = 4653; E = t + K = 4653 + 2987 = 7640; so H = 292 + E = 292 + 7640 = 7932. Define Tiger as F; Z = H = 7932; so F = 521 + Z = 521 + 7932 = 8453. Define Elephant as c; L = F + U = 8453 + 871 = 9324; so c = 434 + L = 434 + 9324 = 9758. Answer: 9758.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Penguin equals 473.
- The number of Sparrow equals 580 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Eagle equals 526 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Owl equals 633 plus the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 849 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Hawk equals 959 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Crow equals the number of Sparrow, and the number of Blue Jay equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Sparrow equals 580 plus the number of Penguin, so the number of Penguin is 580 - number of Sparrow.
- The number of Eagle equals 526 plus the number of Hawk, so the number of Hawk is 526 - number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 633 plus the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 849 plus the number of Crow, so the number of Crow is 849 - number of Parrot.
- Substituting the above equations into the given information, we get:
    - The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Eagle, which equals 526 + number of Hawk.
    - The number of Hawk equals 526 - number of Eagle.
    - Therefore, the number of Blue Jay equals 526 + (526 - number of Eagle).
    - Solving for the number of Blue Jay, we get:
        - 2 * number of Blue Jay = 1052 - number of Eagle
        - number of Blue Jay = (1052 - number of Eagle) / 2

**Answer: (1052 - number of Eagle) / 2**<eos>
Define Penguin as O; so O = 473. Define Sparrow as a; s = O = 473; so a = 580 + s = 580 + 473 = 1053. Define Crow as i; so i = a = 1053. Define Parrot as j; U = i = 1053; so j = 849 + U = 849 + 1053 = 1902. Define Owl as o; P = j + a = 1902 + 1053 = 2955; X = P + i = 2955 + 1053 = 4008; so o = 633 + X = 633 + 4008 = 4641. Define Hawk as G; A = o + a = 4641 + 1053 = 5694; so G = 959 + A = 959 + 5694 = 6653. Define Eagle as b; n = G = 6653; so b = 526 + n = 526 + 6653 = 7179. Define Blue Jay as h; so h = b = 7179. Answer: 7179.
**arguments:**

- the number of crow equals the number of sparrow.
- the number of blue jay equals the number of eagle.
- the number of penguin equals 473.
- the number of sparrow equals 580 plus the number of penguin.
- the number of eagle equals 526 plus the number of hawk.
- the number of owl equals 633 plus the sum of the number of parrot, the number of sparrow, and the number of crow.
- the number of parrot equals 849 plus the number of crow.
- the number of hawk equals 959 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of sparrow.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we know that the number of crow equals the number of sparrow, and the number of blue jay equals the number of eagle.
- the number of sparrow equals 580 plus the number of penguin, so the number of penguin is 580 - number of sparrow.
- the number of eagle equals 526 plus the number of hawk, so the number of hawk is 526 - number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals 633 plus the sum of the number of parrot, the number of sparrow, and the number of crow.
- the number of parrot equals 849 plus the number of crow, so the number of crow is 849 - number of parrot.
- substituting the above equations into the given information, we get:
    - the number of blue jay equals the number of eagle, which equals 526 + number of hawk.
    - the number of hawk equals 526 - number of eagle.
    - therefore, the number of blue jay equals 526 + (526 - number of eagle).
    - solving for the number of blue jay, we get:
        - 2 * number of blue jay = 1052 - number of eagle
        - number of blue jay = (1052 - number of eagle) / 2

- The number of Wolf = Lion + Horse = 0 + Bear = 0 + 1379 = 1379.

**Answer: 1379**<eos>
Define Fox as o; so o = 454. Define Raccoon as G; d = o = 454; so G = 295 + d = 295 + 454 = 749. Define Deer as j; so j = G + o = 749 + 454 = 1203. Define Bear as Q; R = j + G = 1203 + 749 = 1952; so Q = 125 + R = 125 + 1952 = 2077. Define Horse as T; so T = Q + G = 2077 + 749 = 2826. Define Tiger as q; K = T = 2826; so q = 950 + K = 950 + 2826 = 3776. Define Elephant as s; P = q = 3776; so s = 375 + P = 375 + 3776 = 4151. Define Lion as Y; a = s + G = 4151 + 749 = 4900; so Y = a + q = 4900 + 3776 = 8676. Define Wolf as M; so M = Y + T = 8676 + 2826 = 11502. Answer: 11502.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals the number of Lion.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Tiger, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Tiger, and the number of Lion.
- The number of Bear equals 811 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Raccoon equals 409 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Fox, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Tiger equals 227 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 745.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Lion = the number of Elephant = x
- The number of Bear = 811 + x
- The number of Tiger = 227 + x
- The number of Fox = x + 227 + x = 2x + 227
- The number of Raccoon = 409 + 2x + 227 = 636 + 2x
- The number of Deer = 636 + 2x + 811 + x = 1447 + 3x

**Answer: 1447 + 3x**<eos>
Define Wolf as M; so M = 745. Define Tiger as P; l = M = 745; so P = 227 + l = 227 + 745 = 972. Define Bear as S; i = P = 972; so S = 811 + i = 811 + 972 = 1783. Define Lion as U; o = S + P = 1783 + 972 = 2755; so U = o + M = 2755 + 745 = 3500. Define Elephant as t; so t = U = 3500. Define Fox as K; T = t + P = 3500 + 972 = 4472; so K = T + U = 4472 + 3500 = 7972. Define Raccoon as y; B = K = 7972; so y = 409 + B = 409 + 7972 = 8381. Define Deer as r; g = y + K = 8381 + 7972 = 16353; so r = g + S = 16353 + 1783 = 18136. Answer: 18136.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Tiger equals 177 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals 854 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 31.
- The number of Deer equals 170 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Wolf, and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Elephant equals 759 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Raccoon equals 746 plus the number of Tiger.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Bear equals the number of Deer, so let's assume both are x.
- The number of Tiger equals 177 plus the number of Wolf, so we have x = 177 + w.
- The number of Fox equals 854 plus the number of Bear, so we have w = 854 + x.
- The number of Wolf equals 31, so we have w = 31.
- The number of Deer equals 170 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Wolf, and the number of Tiger, so we have x = 170 + 746 + w.
- The number of Elephant equals 759 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Wolf, and the number of Tiger, so we have x = 759 + 854 + w.
- Substituting the value of w from the previous equation, we get x = 759 + 854 + 31 = 1644.

**Answer: 1644**<eos>
Define Wolf as w; so w = 31. Define Tiger as V; z = w = 31; so V = 177 + z = 177 + 31 = 208. Define Raccoon as U; K = V = 208; so U = 746 + K = 746 + 208 = 954. Define Deer as i; S = U + w = 954 + 31 = 985; P = S + V = 985 + 208 = 1193; so i = 170 + P = 170 + 1193 = 1363. Define Bear as g; so g = i = 1363. Define Fox as L; q = g = 1363; so L = 854 + q = 854 + 1363 = 2217. Define Elephant as A; l = L + w = 2217 + 31 = 2248; T = l + V = 2248 + 208 = 2456; so A = 759 + T = 759 + 2456 = 3215. Answer: 3215.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals the number of deer.
- the number of tiger equals 177 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of fox equals 854 plus the number of bear.
- the number of wolf equals 31.
- the number of deer equals 170 plus the sum of the number of raccoon, the number of wolf, and the number of tiger.
- the number of elephant equals 759 plus the sum of the number of fox, the number of wolf, and the number of tiger.
- the number of raccoon equals 746 plus the number of tiger.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we know that the number of bear equals the number of deer, so let's assume both are x.
- the number of tiger equals 177 plus the number of wolf, so we have x = 177 + w.
- the number of fox equals 854 plus the number of bear, so we have w = 854 + x.
- the number of wolf equals 31, so we have w = 31.
- the number of deer equals 170 plus the sum of the number of raccoon, the number of wolf, and the number of tiger, so we have x = 170 + 746 + w.
- the number of elephant equals 759 plus the sum of the number of fox, the number of wolf, and the number of tiger, so we have x = 759 + 854 + w.
- substituting the value of w from the previous equation, we get x = 759 + 854 + 31 = 1644.

- The number of Hawk is 749.
- The number of Blue Jay is 237 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Parrot is the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Hawk, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Sparrow is 351 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle is 862 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Crow is 687 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl is 69 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Hawk, and the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot is 687 + 749 + 986 = 2422.
- The number of Sparrow is 351 + 2422 = 2773.
- The number of Eagle is 862 + (69 + 749) = 1620.

**Answer: 1620**<eos>
Define Hawk as I; so I = 749. Define Blue Jay as G; r = I = 749; so G = 237 + r = 237 + 749 = 986. Define Crow as y; Z = G = 986; so y = 687 + Z = 687 + 986 = 1673. Define Parrot as h; J = y + I = 1673 + 749 = 2422; so h = J + G = 2422 + 986 = 3408. Define Sparrow as E; W = h = 3408; so E = 351 + W = 351 + 3408 = 3759. Define Owl as t; u = E + I = 3759 + 749 = 4508; S = u + h = 4508 + 3408 = 7916; so t = 69 + S = 69 + 7916 = 7985. Define Eagle as c; R = t + I = 7985 + 749 = 8734; so c = 862 + R = 862 + 8734 = 9596. Answer: 9596.

- The number of Elephant equals 807 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Tiger, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Lion.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Deer = Elephant + Tiger + Fox = 807 + 966 + 287 = 2060.
- The number of Lion = 570 + Deer = 570 + 2060 = 2630.
- The number of Raccoon = Fox = 287.
- The number of Fox = 287 + Tiger = 287 + 966 = 1253.
- The number of Wolf = 309 + Lion = 309 + 2630 = 2939.
- The number of Bear = Wolf + Lion = 2939 + 2630 = 5569.

**Answer: 5569**<eos>
Define Tiger as D; so D = 966. Define Fox as h; i = D = 966; so h = 287 + i = 287 + 966 = 1253. Define Raccoon as q; so q = h = 1253. Define Elephant as c; O = q + D = 1253 + 966 = 2219; u = O + h = 2219 + 1253 = 3472; so c = 807 + u = 807 + 3472 = 4279. Define Deer as J; B = c + D = 4279 + 966 = 5245; so J = B + h = 5245 + 1253 = 6498. Define Lion as z; M = J = 6498; so z = 570 + M = 570 + 6498 = 7068. Define Wolf as U; d = z = 7068; so U = 309 + d = 309 + 7068 = 7377. Define Bear as Y; so Y = U + z = 7377 + 7068 = 14445. Answer: 14445.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Wolf equals 421 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Lion.
- The number of Deer equals 286 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Lion equals 477 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Tiger.

- Therefore, the number of Elephant = 286 + Bear + 477 + Fox + Tiger.
- The number of Raccoon = Elephant = 286 + Bear + 477 + Fox + Tiger.
- The number of Wolf = 421 + Raccoon = 421 + (286 + Bear + 477 + Fox + Tiger).

**Answer: 421 + (286 + Bear + 477 + Fox + Tiger)**<eos>
Define Tiger as B; so B = 561. Define Horse as c; S = B = 561; so c = 45 + S = 45 + 561 = 606. Define Fox as q; so q = c + B = 606 + 561 = 1167. Define Lion as k; Y = q + B = 1167 + 561 = 1728; so k = 477 + Y = 477 + 1728 = 2205. Define Bear as e; v = k + B = 2205 + 561 = 2766; so e = v + q = 2766 + 1167 = 3933. Define Deer as L; E = e = 3933; so L = 286 + E = 286 + 3933 = 4219. Define Elephant as H; so H = L + k = 4219 + 2205 = 6424. Define Raccoon as K; so K = H = 6424. Define Wolf as W; p = K = 6424; so W = 421 + p = 421 + 6424 = 6845. Answer: 6845.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 421 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of raccoon equals the number of elephant.

**calculation:**

- the number of elephant equals the sum of the number of deer and the number of lion.
- the number of deer equals 286 plus the number of bear.
- the number of lion equals 477 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of tiger.

- therefore, the number of elephant = 286 + bear + 477 + fox + tiger.
- the number of raccoon = elephant = 286 + bear + 477 + fox + tiger.
- the number of wolf = 421 + raccoon = 421 + (286 + bear + 477 + fox + tiger).

- The number of Crow = 157

**Answer:**

**Answer: 2347**<eos>
Define Crow as n; so n = 157. Define Sparrow as x; so x = n = 157. Define Blue Jay as W; b = x = 157; so W = 952 + b = 952 + 157 = 1109. Define Owl as f; so f = W = 1109. Define Penguin as I; q = f = 1109; so I = 509 + q = 509 + 1109 = 1618. Define Hawk as U; c = I + W = 1618 + 1109 = 2727; k = c + f = 2727 + 1109 = 3836; so U = 964 + k = 964 + 3836 = 4800. Define Parrot as p; X = U = 4800; so p = 980 + X = 980 + 4800 = 5780. Define Eagle as V; j = p + f = 5780 + 1109 = 6889; so V = j + U = 6889 + 4800 = 11689. Answer: 11689.

= 2614

**Answer: 2614**<eos>
Define Hawk as i; so i = 661. Define Peacock as W; E = i = 661; so W = 550 + E = 550 + 661 = 1211. Define Penguin as u; f = W = 1211; so u = 898 + f = 898 + 1211 = 2109. Define Parrot as B; R = u + W = 2109 + 1211 = 3320; so B = 142 + R = 142 + 3320 = 3462. Define Eagle as K; h = B + u = 3462 + 2109 = 5571; so K = h + i = 5571 + 661 = 6232. Define Sparrow as G; v = K = 6232; so G = 733 + v = 733 + 6232 = 6965. Define Owl as T; C = G + B = 6965 + 3462 = 10427; A = C + K = 10427 + 6232 = 16659; so T = A + u = 16659 + 2109 = 18768.

- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Parrot, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals 752 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals 174 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Crow, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 368 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 294.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Hawk = 662 + (Crow + Parrot) = 662 + (368 + 294) = 662 + 662 = 1324.
- The number of Crow = 368 + Parrot = 368 + 294 = 662.
- The number of Sparrow = Hawk + Parrot + Crow = 1324 + 294 + 662 = 2280.
- The number of Blue Jay = 762 + Eagle = 762 + 174 = 936.
- The number of Owl = 752 + Blue Jay = 752 + 936 = 1688.

**Answer: 1688**<eos>
Define Parrot as s; so s = 294. Define Crow as H; c = s = 294; so H = 368 + c = 368 + 294 = 662. Define Hawk as t; W = H + s = 662 + 294 = 956; so t = 662 + W = 662 + 956 = 1618. Define Sparrow as T; U = t + s = 1618 + 294 = 1912; so T = U + H = 1912 + 662 = 2574. Define Eagle as o; n = T + H = 2574 + 662 = 3236; y = n + s = 3236 + 294 = 3530; so o = 174 + y = 174 + 3530 = 3704. Define Blue Jay as x; A = o = 3704; so x = 762 + A = 762 + 3704 = 4466. Define Owl as w; v = x = 4466; so w = 752 + v = 752 + 4466 = 5218. Answer: 5218.
**arguments:**

- the number of hawk equals 662 plus the sum of the number of crow and the number of parrot.
- the number of blue jay equals 762 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of hawk, the number of parrot, and the number of crow.
- the number of owl equals 752 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of eagle equals 174 plus the sum of the number of sparrow, the number of crow, and the number of parrot.
- the number of crow equals 368 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 294.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question!

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 174 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 604 plus the number of Peacock.
- The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Peacock.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Sparrow equals 85 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Peacock equals 779.
- The number of Crow equals 430 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot equals 173 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Peacock.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot = 174 + 173 = 347
- The number of Blue Jay = 174
- The number of Owl = 604 - 779 = -175 (Since the number of Owl cannot be negative, we assume there is no Owl in the location)
- The number of Peacock = 779
- The number of Penguin = -175 + 779 = 604
- The number of Hawk = 604
- The number of Sparrow = 85 + 604 = 689
- The number of Crow = 430 + 689 = 1119

**Answer: 1119**<eos>
Define Peacock as F; so F = 779. Define Owl as h; O = F = 779; so h = 604 + O = 604 + 779 = 1383. Define Penguin as S; so S = h + F = 1383 + 779 = 2162. Define Parrot as f; z = S + F = 2162 + 779 = 2941; so f = 173 + z = 173 + 2941 = 3114. Define Blue Jay as i; Z = f = 3114; so i = 174 + Z = 174 + 3114 = 3288. Define Eagle as k; so k = i = 3288. Define Hawk as r; so r = k = 3288. Define Sparrow as G; X = r + k = 3288 + 3288 = 6576; so G = 85 + X = 85 + 6576 = 6661. Define Crow as j; Y = G = 6661; so j = 430 + Y = 430 + 6661 = 7091. Answer: 7091.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals 508.
- The number of Fox equals 433 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Deer equals 417 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Elephant equals 22 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Raccoon equals 182 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Wolf equals 786 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 985 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Elephant, and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Elephant is 508 - 22 = 486.
- The number of Fox is 433 + 486 = 919.
- The number of Deer is 417 + 919 = 1336.
- The number of Bear is 182 + 985 = 1167.
- The number of Raccoon is 182 + 1167 = 1349.

**Answer: 1349**<eos>
Define Tiger as A; so A = 508. Define Elephant as Y; D = A = 508; so Y = 22 + D = 22 + 508 = 530. Define Fox as o; g = Y = 530; so o = 433 + g = 433 + 530 = 963. Define Deer as t; j = o + A = 963 + 508 = 1471; so t = 417 + j = 417 + 1471 = 1888. Define Wolf as K; w = t + o = 1888 + 963 = 2851; so K = 786 + w = 786 + 2851 = 3637. Define Bear as R; G = K + Y = 3637 + 530 = 4167; q = G + t = 4167 + 1888 = 6055; so R = 985 + q = 985 + 6055 = 7040. Define Raccoon as U; N = R = 7040; so U = 182 + N = 182 + 7040 = 7222.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 573 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Penguin equals 583 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Peacock equals 578 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 162.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Penguin, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 581 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Eagle equals 453.
- The number of Sparrow equals 318 plus the number of Peacock.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate:
    - Parrot = 573 + Penguin + Blue Jay = 573 + (583 + Blue Jay)
    - Penguin = 583 + Blue Jay
    - Peacock = 578 + Owl + Parrot = 578 + Owl + (573 + Penguin + Blue Jay)
    - Blue Jay = 162
    - Hawk = Sparrow + Penguin + Parrot
    - Owl = Parrot
    - Crow = 581 + Hawk
    - Sparrow = 318 + Peacock

- Substituting the value of Blue Jay and Owl into the above equations, we get:
    - Parrot = 573 + 583 + 162 = 1318
    - Penguin = 583 + 162 = 745
    - Peacock = 578 + 1318 + 162 = 1052
    - Hawk = 318 + 745 + 1318 = 2381
    - Crow = 581 + 2381 = 3062

**Answer: 3062**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as S; so S = 162. Define Penguin as J; D = S = 162; so J = 583 + D = 583 + 162 = 745. Define Parrot as z; p = J + S = 745 + 162 = 907; so z = 573 + p = 573 + 907 = 1480. Define Owl as w; so w = z = 1480. Define Peacock as a; R = w + z = 1480 + 1480 = 2960; so a = 578 + R = 578 + 2960 = 3538. Define Sparrow as h; A = a = 3538; so h = 318 + A = 318 + 3538 = 3856. Define Hawk as x; m = h + J = 3856 + 745 = 4601; so x = m + z = 4601 + 1480 = 6081. Define Crow as C; L = x = 6081; so C = 581 + L = 581 + 6081 = 6662. Answer: 6662.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 573 plus the sum of the number of penguin and the number of blue jay.
- the number of penguin equals 583 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of peacock equals 578 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of parrot.

- the number of hawk equals the sum of the number of sparrow, the number of penguin, and the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals the number of parrot.
- the number of crow equals 581 plus the number of hawk.
- the number of eagle equals 453.
- the number of sparrow equals 318 plus the number of peacock.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate:
    - parrot = 573 + penguin + blue jay = 573 + (583 + blue jay)
    - penguin = 583 + blue jay
    - peacock = 578 + owl + parrot = 578 + owl + (573 + penguin + blue jay)
    - blue jay = 162
    - hawk = sparrow + penguin + parrot
    - owl = parrot
    - crow = 581 + hawk
    - sparrow = 318 + peacock

- substituting the value of blue jay and owl into the above equations, we get:
    - parrot = 573 + 583 + 162 = 1318
    - penguin = 583 + 162 = 745
    - peacock = 578 + 1318 + 162 = 1052
    - hawk = 318 + 745 + 1318 = 2381

- The number of Wolf equals the number of Bear.
- The number of Lion equals 583 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Tiger equals 199 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Bear equals 21.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Lion equals 412 + x (where x is the number of Lion).
- The number of Raccoon equals Fox + Wolf + Bear + Elephant = Fox + Wolf + 412 + x.
- The number of Fox equals Deer = 206 + x.
- The number of Deer equals 206 + Elephant + Wolf = 206 + 412 + x + Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals Bear = 21.
- The number of Tiger equals 199 + Raccoon = 199 + Fox + Wolf + Bear + Elephant.

**Answer:**

**Answer: 722**<eos>
Define Bear as e; so e = 21. Define Wolf as F; so F = e = 21. Define Lion as f; I = F = 21; so f = 583 + I = 583 + 21 = 604. Define Elephant as B; W = f = 604; so B = 412 + W = 412 + 604 = 1016. Define Deer as N; M = B + F = 1016 + 21 = 1037; so N = 206 + M = 206 + 1037 = 1243. Define Fox as a; so a = N = 1243. Define Raccoon as U; v = a + F = 1243 + 21 = 1264; E = v + e = 1264 + 21 = 1285; so U = E + B = 1285 + 1016 = 2301. Define Tiger as r; L = U = 2301; so r = 199 + L = 199 + 2301 = 2500. Answer: 2500.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 526 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 148 plus the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals 150 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Wolf equals 12 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Fox, and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Fox equals 499 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Tiger equals 819.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Deer as:
Number of Deer = 148 + (Number of Elephant + Number of Raccoon + Number of Wolf)
- We can also calculate the number of Raccoon as:
Number of Raccoon = 150 + Number of Fox
- And the number of Wolf as:
Number of Wolf = 12 + Number of Tiger
- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Elephant as:
Number of Elephant = Number of Raccoon + Number of Fox + Number of Tiger
- And the number of Fox as:
Number of Fox = 499 + Number of Wolf + Number of Tiger
- And the number of Tiger as:
Number of Tiger = 819
- Substituting these values into the above equations, we can calculate the number of Deer as:
Number of Deer = 148 + (499 + 150 + 819) = 148 + 1448 = 1596
- And the number of Bear as:
Number of Bear = 526 + Number of Deer = 526 + 1596 = 2122

**Answer: 2122**<eos>
Define Tiger as u; so u = 819. Define Wolf as V; Z = u = 819; so V = 12 + Z = 12 + 819 = 831. Define Fox as G; A = V + u = 831 + 819 = 1650; so G = 499 + A = 499 + 1650 = 2149. Define Raccoon as E; c = G = 2149; so E = 150 + c = 150 + 2149 = 2299. Define Elephant as D; N = E + G = 2299 + 2149 = 4448; so D = N + u = 4448 + 819 = 5267. Define Deer as t; g = D + E = 5267 + 2299 = 7566; y = g + V = 7566 + 831 = 8397; so t = 148 + y = 148 + 8397 = 8545. Define Bear as Q; Y = t = 8545; so Q = 526 + Y = 526 + 8545 = 9071. Answer: 9071.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 526 plus the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 148 plus the sum of the number of elephant, the number of raccoon, and the number of wolf.
- the number of raccoon equals 150 plus the number of fox.

- the number of fox equals 499 plus the sum of the number of wolf and the number of tiger.
- the number of tiger equals 819.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of deer as:
number of deer = 148 + (number of elephant + number of raccoon + number of wolf)
- we can also calculate the number of raccoon as:
number of raccoon = 150 + number of fox
- and the number of wolf as:
number of wolf = 12 + number of tiger
- from the given information, we can calculate the number of elephant as:
number of elephant = number of raccoon + number of fox + number of tiger
- and the number of fox as:
number of fox = 499 + number of wolf + number of tiger
- and the number of tiger as:
number of tiger = 819
- substituting these values into the above equations, we can calculate the number of deer as:
number of deer = 148 + (499 + 150 + 819) = 148 + 1448 = 1596
- and the number of bear as:
number of bear = 526 + number of deer = 526 + 1596 = 2122

**Arguments:**

- The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Crow, and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Eagle equals 569 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Penguin.
- The number of Sparrow equals 425 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Hawk equals 989 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Penguin, the number of Owl, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 23 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals 88.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Penguin = Sparrow + Crow + Hawk = 425 + 88 + 989 = 1502.
- The number of Blue Jay = Penguin + Owl + Crow = 1502 + Owl + 88 = 1590 + Owl.
- The number of Eagle = 569 + Blue Jay = 569 + 1590 + Owl = 2159 + Owl.
- Therefore, the number of Eagle is 2159 + Owl.

**Answer: 2159 + Owl**<eos>
Define Crow as z; so z = 88. Define Parrot as u; R = z = 88; so u = 23 + R = 23 + 88 = 111. Define Hawk as C; B = u = 111; so C = 989 + B = 989 + 111 = 1100. Define Owl as i; so i = C + z = 1100 + 88 = 1188. Define Sparrow as b; w = i = 1188; so b = 425 + w = 425 + 1188 = 1613. Define Penguin as Z; n = b + z = 1613 + 88 = 1701; so Z = n + C = 1701 + 1100 = 2801. Define Blue Jay as k; q = Z + i = 2801 + 1188 = 3989; so k = q + z = 3989 + 88 = 4077. Define Eagle as h; p = k + Z = 4077 + 2801 = 6878; so h = 569 + p = 569 + 6878 = 7447. Answer: 7447.
**arguments:**

- the number of penguin equals the sum of the number of sparrow, the number of crow, and the number of hawk.
- the number of eagle equals 569 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of penguin.
- the number of sparrow equals 425 plus the number of owl.

- The number of Eagle equals 44 + Blue Jay + Owl + Penguin (given).
- The number of Sparrow equals 494 + Owl + Penguin (given).
- The number of Parrot equals 189 (given).
- The number of Penguin equals 708 + Parrot (given).
- The number of Blue Jay equals Sparrow (given).

Substituting the above equations into each other, we get:

- Hawk = Eagle = 44 + Blue Jay + Owl + Penguin.
- Owl = 29 + Crow = 29 + 389 + Penguin.
- Crow = 389 + Penguin.
- Penguin = 708 + Parrot.
- Sparrow = 494 + Owl + Penguin = 494 + (29 + Crow) + Penguin.
- Blue Jay = Sparrow = 494 + (29 + Crow) + Penguin.

Therefore, the number of Hawk is:

Hawk = Eagle = 44 + Blue Jay + Owl + Penguin = 44 + (494 + (29 + Crow) + Penguin) + 29 + Crow + Penguin = 562 + 2*Crow + 2*Penguin.

**Answer: 562 + 2*Crow + 2*Penguin**<eos>
Define Parrot as y; so y = 189. Define Penguin as m; c = y = 189; so m = 708 + c = 708 + 189 = 897. Define Crow as H; S = m = 897; so H = 389 + S = 389 + 897 = 1286. Define Owl as F; f = H = 1286; so F = 29 + f = 29 + 1286 = 1315. Define Sparrow as U; t = F + m = 1315 + 897 = 2212; so U = 494 + t = 494 + 2212 = 2706. Define Blue Jay as T; so T = U = 2706. Define Eagle as G; w = T + F = 2706 + 1315 = 4021; Q = w + m = 4021 + 897 = 4918; so G = 44 + Q = 44 + 4918 = 4962. Define Hawk as J; so J = G = 4962. Answer: 4962.
**arguments:**

- the number of hawk equals the number of eagle.
- the number of owl equals 29 plus the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals 389 plus the number of penguin.
- the number of eagle equals 44 plus the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of owl, and the number of penguin.
- the number of sparrow equals 494 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of penguin.
- the number of parrot equals 189.
- the number of penguin equals 708 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of blue jay equals the number of sparrow.

**calculation:**

- the number of eagle equals the number of hawk (given).
- the number of owl equals 29 + crow (given).
- the number of crow equals 389 + penguin (given).
- the number of eagle equals 44 + blue jay + owl + penguin (given).
- the number of sparrow equals 494 + owl + penguin (given).
- the number of parrot equals 189 (given).
- the number of penguin equals 708 + parrot (given).
- the number of blue jay equals sparrow (given).

substituting the above equations into each other, we get:

- hawk = eagle = 44 + blue jay + owl + penguin.
- owl = 29 + crow = 29 + 389 + penguin.
- crow = 389 + penguin.
- penguin = 708 + parrot.
- sparrow = 494 + owl + penguin = 494 + (29 + crow) + penguin.
- blue jay = sparrow = 494 + (29 + crow) + penguin.

therefore, the number of hawk is:

hawk = eagle = 44 + blue jay + owl + penguin = 44 + (494 + (29 + crow) + penguin) + 29 + crow + penguin = 562 + 2*crow + 2*penguin.

**answer: 562 + 2*crow + 2*penguin**<eos>

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated. Problem: The number of Hawk equals 346 plus the number of Owl.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Hawk equals 346 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 135 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 613 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have the number of Hawk = 346 + Owl.
- From the second equation, we have the number of Owl = 135 + Eagle.
- Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
  Number of Hawk = 346 + (135 + Eagle)
  Number of Hawk = 346 + 135 + Eagle
  Number of Hawk = 481 + Eagle.

**Answer: 481 + Eagle**<eos>
Define Crow as v; so v = 831. Define Sparrow as Q; z = v = 831; so Q = 325 + z = 325 + 831 = 1156. Define Parrot as L; y = Q = 1156; so L = 300 + y = 300 + 1156 = 1456. Define Blue Jay as t; F = L + Q = 1456 + 1156 = 2612; so t = 246 + F = 246 + 2612 = 2858. Define Penguin as U; so U = t + v = 2858 + 831 = 3689. Define Eagle as C; K = U + L = 3689 + 1456 = 5145; so C = 613 + K = 613 + 5145 = 5758. Define Owl as O; J = C = 5758; so O = 135 + J = 135 + 5758 = 5893. Define Hawk as f; Z = O = 5893; so f = 346 + Z = 346 + 5893 = 6239. Answer: 6239.
**arguments:**

- the number of hawk equals 346 plus the number of owl.
- the number of owl equals 135 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of eagle equals 613 plus the sum of the number of penguin and the number of parrot.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have the number of hawk = 346 + owl.
- from the second equation, we have the number of owl = 135 + eagle.
- substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
  number of hawk = 346 + (135 + eagle)
  number of hawk = 346 + 135 + eagle
  number of hawk = 481 + eagle.

**answer: 481 + eagle**<eos>

- The number of Crow equals 2740 + 1117 + 999 = 4856.
- The number of Parrot equals 737 + 4856 = 5593.

**Answer: 5593**<eos>
Define Sparrow as U; so U = 999. Define Owl as r; P = U = 999; so r = 19 + P = 19 + 999 = 1018. Define Hawk as w; W = r + U = 1018 + 999 = 2017; so w = 929 + W = 929 + 2017 = 2946. Define Eagle as B; Q = w = 2946; so B = 924 + Q = 924 + 2946 = 3870. Define Penguin as m; i = B = 3870; so m = 897 + i = 897 + 3870 = 4767. Define Crow as l; V = m + w = 4767 + 2946 = 7713; so l = V + U = 7713 + 999 = 8712. Define Blue Jay as t; so t = l = 8712. Define Parrot as b; Y = t = 8712; so b = 737 + Y = 737 + 8712 = 9449.

- The number of Wolf is 184 + 1611 = 1795.
- The number of Deer is 84 + 1795 = 1879.

**Answer: 1879**<eos>
Define Fox as H; so H = 65. Define Raccoon as p; so p = H = 65. Define Tiger as v; I = p = 65; so v = 530 + I = 530 + 65 = 595. Define Elephant as n; g = v + H = 595 + 65 = 660; R = g + p = 660 + 65 = 725; so n = 418 + R = 418 + 725 = 1143. Define Bear as K; D = n + H = 1143 + 65 = 1208; X = D + p = 1208 + 65 = 1273; so K = 558 + X = 558 + 1273 = 1831. Define Wolf as S; k = K = 1831; so S = 184 + k = 184 + 1831 = 2015. Define Deer as r; N = S = 2015; so r = 84 + N = 84 + 2015 = 2099. Answer: 2099.

- The number of Raccoon equals 278 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Tiger equals 986 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 47 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Deer = 323 + 47 = **370**

**Answer: 370**<eos>
Define Wolf as T; so T = 154. Define Raccoon as e; N = T = 154; so e = 278 + N = 278 + 154 = 432. Define Elephant as z; k = e + T = 432 + 154 = 586; so z = 571 + k = 571 + 586 = 1157. Define Bear as J; Z = z + T = 1157 + 154 = 1311; i = Z + e = 1311 + 432 = 1743; so J = 533 + i = 533 + 1743 = 2276. Define Tiger as g; u = J = 2276; so g = 986 + u = 986 + 2276 = 3262. Define Fox as M; U = g + J = 3262 + 2276 = 5538; so M = 47 + U = 47 + 5538 = 5585. Define Deer as D; p = M = 5585; so D = 323 + p = 323 + 5585 = 5908. Answer: 5908.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Raccoon equals 915 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals 654 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Elephant = 654 + 898 = 1552.
- The number of Raccoon = 915 + 1552 = 2467.
- The number of Bear = Fox + Raccoon + Elephant = unknown + 2467 + 1552 = unknown + 4019.

**Answer: Answer: unknown + 4019**<eos>
Define Wolf as C; so C = 898. Define Elephant as N; t = C = 898; so N = 654 + t = 654 + 898 = 1552. Define Raccoon as u; e = N = 1552; so u = 915 + e = 915 + 1552 = 2467. Define Horse as w; L = u + N = 2467 + 1552 = 4019; so w = L + C = 4019 + 898 = 4917. Define Lion as q; so q = w + u = 4917 + 2467 = 7384. Define Deer as i; b = q = 7384; so i = 876 + b = 876 + 7384 = 8260. Define Tiger as s; so s = i = 8260. Define Fox as M; so M = s + N = 8260 + 1552 = 9812. Define Bear as F; O = M + u = 9812 + 2467 = 12279; so F = O + N = 12279 + 1552 = 13831. Answer: 13831.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 733 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Sparrow equals 127 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 31 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Crow, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Hawk equals 283 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 19.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot = 733 + Penguin number (given)
- The number of Penguin = Hawk number + Crow number + Blue Jay number (given)
- The number of Crow = Sparrow number + Blue Jay number (given)
- The number of Owl = 31 + Blue Jay number (given)
- The number of Eagle = Crow number + Blue Jay number + Owl number (given)
- The number of Hawk = 283 + Eagle number + Owl number (given)
- The number of Blue Jay = 19 (given)

Substituting the given value of Blue Jay number into the above equations, we get:

- The number of Parrot = 733 + Penguin number
- The number of Penguin = 283 + Crow number + 19
- The number of Crow = 127 + 19
- The number of Owl = 31 + 19
- The number of Eagle = Crow number + 19 + Owl number
- The number of Hawk = 283 + (Crow number + 19 + Owl number) + Owl number

Simplifying the equations, we get:

- The number of Parrot = 733 + Penguin number
- The number of Penguin = 283 + 127 + 19
- The number of Crow = 127 + 19
- The number of Owl = 31 + 19
- The number of Eagle = 127 + 19 + Owl number
- The number of Hawk = 283 + 127 + 19 + Owl number

Therefore, the number of Parrot is 733 + Penguin number.<eos>
Define Blue Jay as Z; so Z = 19. Define Owl as y; p = Z = 19; so y = 31 + p = 31 + 19 = 50. Define Sparrow as a; w = y = 50; so a = 127 + w = 127 + 50 = 177. Define Crow as b; so b = a + Z = 177 + 19 = 196. Define Eagle as f; l = b + Z = 196 + 19 = 215; so f = l + y = 215 + 50 = 265. Define Hawk as n; q = f + y = 265 + 50 = 315; so n = 283 + q = 283 + 315 = 598. Define Penguin as P; J = n + b = 598 + 196 = 794; so P = J + Z = 794 + 19 = 813. Define Parrot as c; A = P = 813; so c = 733 + A = 733 + 813 = 1546. Answer: 1546.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 733 plus the number of penguin.
- the number of sparrow equals 127 plus the number of owl.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of sparrow and the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals 31 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of penguin equals the sum of the number of hawk, the number of crow, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of crow, the number of blue jay, and the number of owl.
- the number of hawk equals 283 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of owl.
- the number of blue jay equals 19.

**calculation:**

- the number of parrot = 733 + penguin number (given)
- the number of penguin = hawk number + crow number + blue jay number (given)
- the number of crow = sparrow number + blue jay number (given)
- the number of owl = 31 + blue jay number (given)
- the number of eagle = crow number + blue jay number + owl number (given)
- the number of hawk = 283 + eagle number + owl number (given)
- the number of blue jay = 19 (given)

substituting the given value of blue jay number into the above equations, we get:

- the number of parrot = 733 + penguin number
- the number of penguin = 283 + crow number + 19
- the number of crow = 127 + 19
- the number of owl = 31 + 19
- the number of eagle = crow number + 19 + owl number
- the number of hawk = 283 + (crow number + 19 + owl number) + owl number

**Arguments:**

- The number of Horse equals the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Tiger equals 639 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Lion, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 590 plus the number of Lion.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Horse = Number of Tiger + Number of Elephant
= (639 + Number of Elephant) + Number of Elephant
= 639 + 2 * Number of Elephant

- The number of Elephant = Number of Bear + Number of Lion + Number of Deer
= Number of Bear + 533 + 590 + Number of Lion
= Number of Bear + 1123 + Number of Lion

- The number of Horse = 639 + 2 * (Number of Bear + 1123 + Number of Lion)
= 639 + 2 * Number of Bear + 2 * 1123 + 2 * Number of Lion
= 639 + 2 * Number of Bear + 2246 + 2 * Number of Lion

**Answer: Answer: 3885 + 2 * Number of Bear + 2 * Number of Lion**<eos>
Define Lion as i; so i = 533. Define Deer as H; g = i = 533; so H = 590 + g = 590 + 533 = 1123. Define Wolf as X; z = H + i = 1123 + 533 = 1656; so X = 557 + z = 557 + 1656 = 2213. Define Raccoon as A; T = X = 2213; so A = 3 + T = 3 + 2213 = 2216. Define Fox as r; so r = A + i = 2216 + 533 = 2749. Define Bear as J; so J = r = 2749. Define Elephant as m; Q = J + i = 2749 + 533 = 3282; so m = Q + H = 3282 + 1123 = 4405. Define Tiger as F; h = m = 4405; so F = 639 + h = 639 + 4405 = 5044. Define Horse as w; so w = F + m = 5044 + 4405 = 9449. Answer: 9449.
**arguments:**

- the number of horse equals the sum of the number of tiger and the number of elephant.
- the number of tiger equals 639 plus the number of elephant.
- the number of elephant equals the sum of the number of bear, the number of lion, and the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 590 plus the number of lion.

**calculation:**

- the number of horse = number of tiger + number of elephant
= (639 + number of elephant) + number of elephant
= 639 + 2 * number of elephant

- the number of elephant = number of bear + number of lion + number of deer
= number of bear + 533 + 590 + number of lion
= number of bear + 1123 + number of lion

- the number of horse = 639 + 2 * (number of bear + 1123 + number of lion)
= 639 + 2 * number of bear + 2 * 1123 + 2 * number of lion
= 639 + 2 * number of bear + 2246 + 2 * number of lion

**answer: answer: 3885 + 2 * number of bear + 2 * number of lion**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 928.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Lion equals 806 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Tiger.
- The number of Bear equals 107 plus the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Elephant, and the number of Lion.
- The number of Wolf equals 869 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Raccoon equals 620 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Tiger equals 562 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Deer = 928 + Lion
- The number of Lion = 806 + 928 = 1734
- The number of Deer = 928 + 1734 = 2662
- The number of Fox = Tiger = 562
- The number of Bear = 107 + 2662 + 1734 = 4433
- The number of Wolf = 869 + 562 = 1431

**Answer: 1431**<eos>
Define Elephant as n; so n = 928. Define Lion as Y; C = n = 928; so Y = 806 + C = 806 + 928 = 1734. Define Deer as K; so K = Y + n = 1734 + 928 = 2662. Define Bear as i; M = K + n = 2662 + 928 = 3590; a = M + Y = 3590 + 1734 = 5324; so i = 107 + a = 107 + 5324 = 5431. Define Raccoon as Z; f = i = 5431; so Z = 620 + f = 620 + 5431 = 6051. Define Tiger as V; W = Z + n = 6051 + 928 = 6979; so V = 562 + W = 562 + 6979 = 7541. Define Fox as c; so c = V = 7541. Define Wolf as N; m = c = 7541; so N = 869 + m = 869 + 7541 = 8410.

- The number of Parrot = 767 + Crow + Eagle.
- The sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Blue Jay = Sparrow - 508 = (Hawk + Blue Jay) - 508.
- The number of Hawk = 88 + Blue Jay - Sparrow = 88 + 787 - 508 = 271.
- The number of Penguin = Owl = 842 + Sparrow = 842 + 508 = 1350.
- The number of Crow = 148 + Penguin = 148 + 1350 = 1498.

**Answer: Parrot = 767 + Crow + Eagle = 767 + 1498 + 97 = 2362**<eos>
Define Eagle as y; so y = 97. Define Blue Jay as j; b = y = 97; so j = 690 + b = 690 + 97 = 787. Define Hawk as H; A = j + y = 787 + 97 = 884; so H = 88 + A = 88 + 884 = 972. Define Sparrow as m; J = H + j = 972 + 787 = 1759; so m = 508 + J = 508 + 1759 = 2267. Define Owl as o; M = m = 2267; so o = 842 + M = 842 + 2267 = 3109. Define Penguin as I; so I = o = 3109. Define Crow as Y; Q = I = 3109; so Y = 148 + Q = 148 + 3109 = 3257. Define Parrot as z; n = Y + y = 3257 + 97 = 3354; so z = 767 + n = 767 + 3354 = 4121. Answer: 4121.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 97.
- the number of blue jay equals 690 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of parrot equals 767 plus the sum of the number of crow and the number of eagle.
- the number of sparrow equals 508 plus the sum of the number of hawk and the number of blue jay.

- the number of hawk equals 88 plus the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of eagle.
- the number of penguin equals the number of owl.
- the number of crow equals 148 plus the number of penguin.

**calculation:**

- the number of blue jay = 690 + 97 = 787.
- the sum of the number of crow and the number of eagle = parrot - 767 = (767 + crow + eagle) - 767 = crow + eagle.
- the number of parrot = 767 + crow + eagle.
- the sum of the number of hawk and the number of blue jay = sparrow - 508 = (hawk + blue jay) - 508.
- the number of hawk = 88 + blue jay - sparrow = 88 + 787 - 508 = 271.
- the number of penguin = owl = 842 + sparrow = 842 + 508 = 1350.
- the number of crow = 148 + penguin = 148 + 1350 = 1498.

- The number of Raccoon equals 366 + 1117 = 1483.
- The number of Bear equals 824 + 1483 = 2307.
- The number of Deer equals 874 + 2307 = 3181.

**Answer: 3181**<eos>
Define Elephant as v; so v = 132. Define Tiger as w; a = v = 132; so w = 253 + a = 253 + 132 = 385. Define Wolf as n; x = w = 385; so n = 978 + x = 978 + 385 = 1363. Define Fox as b; so b = n = 1363. Define Lion as N; Z = b + v = 1363 + 132 = 1495; so N = 139 + Z = 139 + 1495 = 1634. Define Raccoon as A; e = N = 1634; so A = 366 + e = 366 + 1634 = 2000. Define Bear as U; G = A = 2000; so U = 824 + G = 824 + 2000 = 2824. Define Deer as H; d = U + N = 2824 + 1634 = 4458; so H = 874 + d = 874 + 4458 = 5332. Answer: 5332.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Penguin, and the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals the number of Owl.
- The number of Sparrow equals 83 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Penguin equals 237 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Parrot equals 570 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Owl equals 45 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Hawk equals 610.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 707 plus the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle as:
Number of Eagle = Number of Crow + Number of Penguin + Number of Owl
Number of Eagle = Number of Owl + Number of Penguin + Number of Owl
Number of Eagle = 2 * Number of Owl + Number of Penguin

- We can also calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = 83 + Number of Eagle
Number of Sparrow = 83 + 2 * Number of Owl + Number of Penguin

- However, we are not given any information about the number of Blue Jay or Hawk, so we cannot calculate the number of Penguin or Owl.

**Answer:**

Answer: Cannot be determined from the given information.<eos>
Define Hawk as q; so q = 610. Define Parrot as i; l = q = 610; so i = 570 + l = 570 + 610 = 1180. Define Blue Jay as d; D = i = 1180; so d = 707 + D = 707 + 1180 = 1887. Define Penguin as z; Y = d + q = 1887 + 610 = 2497; so z = 237 + Y = 237 + 2497 = 2734. Define Owl as k; T = z + d = 2734 + 1887 = 4621; so k = 45 + T = 45 + 4621 = 4666. Define Crow as x; so x = k = 4666. Define Eagle as m; f = x + z = 4666 + 2734 = 7400; so m = f + k = 7400 + 4666 = 12066. Define Sparrow as J; G = m = 12066; so J = 83 + G = 83 + 12066 = 12149. Answer: 12149.

- The number of Tiger is: 673 + 875 = 1548.
- The number of Wolf is: 1548 + 1536 + 691 = 3775.

**Answer: 3775**<eos>
Define Fox as R; so R = 204. Define Raccoon as A; i = R = 204; so A = 487 + i = 487 + 204 = 691. Define Bear as F; j = A + R = 691 + 204 = 895; so F = 845 + j = 845 + 895 = 1740. Define Elephant as h; b = F + R = 1740 + 204 = 1944; Y = b + A = 1944 + 691 = 2635; so h = 399 + Y = 399 + 2635 = 3034. Define Deer as X; C = h = 3034; so X = 875 + C = 875 + 3034 = 3909. Define Tiger as P; e = X = 3909; so P = 673 + e = 673 + 3909 = 4582. Define Wolf as k; a = P + h = 4582 + 3034 = 7616; so k = a + A = 7616 + 691 = 8307. Answer: 8307.

- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Elephant, and the number of Fox.
- The number of Elephant equals 504 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 514.
- The number of Tiger equals 803 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 269 plus the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Elephant, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 89 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Bear, and the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon = Bear + Elephant + Fox = Bear + 504 + 514
- The number of Deer = Raccoon + Bear + Fox = Raccoon + Bear + 504 + 514
- The number of Wolf = 269 + Tiger + Elephant + Deer = 269 + (803 + Deer) + Bear + Raccoon + 504 + 514
- The number of Wolf = 269 + 803 + Bear + Raccoon + 1018

**Answer: Answer: 1610**<eos>
Define Fox as y; so y = 514. Define Elephant as H; S = y = 514; so H = 504 + S = 504 + 514 = 1018. Define Bear as E; V = H = 1018; so E = 89 + V = 89 + 1018 = 1107. Define Raccoon as J; e = E + H = 1107 + 1018 = 2125; so J = e + y = 2125 + 514 = 2639. Define Deer as m; Y = J + E = 2639 + 1107 = 3746; so m = Y + y = 3746 + 514 = 4260. Define Tiger as w; k = m = 4260; so w = 803 + k = 803 + 4260 = 5063. Define Wolf as g; X = w + H = 5063 + 1018 = 6081; T = X + m = 6081 + 4260 = 10341; so g = 269 + T = 269 + 10341 = 10610.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 731 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk equals 935 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Sparrow equals 261 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 929 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 552 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot equals 39 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Owl, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Owl equals 845.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Crow and Sparrow:
  Number of Crow = 731 + Number of Sparrow
  Number of Sparrow = 261 + Number of Owl
  Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
  Number of Crow = 731 + (261 + Number of Owl)
  Number of Crow = 992 + Number of Owl

- We can also calculate the number of Hawk:
  Number of Hawk = 935 + (Number of Eagle + Number of Owl)
  Substituting the equation for Number of Eagle from the given information, we get:
  Number of Hawk = 935 + (929 + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Owl)
  Number of Hawk = 1864 + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Owl

- Finally, we can calculate the number of Owl:
  Number of Owl = 845

**Answer:**

**Answer: 1864**<eos>
Define Owl as w; so w = 845. Define Sparrow as K; L = w = 845; so K = 261 + L = 261 + 845 = 1106. Define Crow as Y; h = K = 1106; so Y = 731 + h = 731 + 1106 = 1837. Define Parrot as f; v = Y + w = 1837 + 845 = 2682; F = v + K = 2682 + 1106 = 3788; so f = 39 + F = 39 + 3788 = 3827. Define Blue Jay as u; p = f + w = 3827 + 845 = 4672; so u = 552 + p = 552 + 4672 = 5224. Define Eagle as H; N = u = 5224; so H = 929 + N = 929 + 5224 = 6153. Define Hawk as X; i = H + w = 6153 + 845 = 6998; so X = 935 + i = 935 + 6998 = 7933. Answer: 7933.

- the number of owl equals 845.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of crow and sparrow:
  number of crow = 731 + number of sparrow
  number of sparrow = 261 + number of owl
  substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
  number of crow = 731 + (261 + number of owl)
  number of crow = 992 + number of owl

- we can also calculate the number of hawk:
  number of hawk = 935 + (number of eagle + number of owl)
  substituting the equation for number of eagle from the given information, we get:
  number of hawk = 935 + (929 + number of blue jay + number of owl)
  number of hawk = 1864 + number of blue jay + number of owl

- finally, we can calculate the number of owl:
  number of owl = 845

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals 802.
- The number of Elephant equals 284 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Bear equals 293 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Horse.
- The number of Horse equals 925 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Lion equals 747 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals 918 plus the number of Horse.
- The number of Raccoon equals 696.
- The number of Deer equals 523 plus the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Lion equals 747 plus the number of Deer = 747 + 523 = 1270.
- The number of Elephant equals 284 plus the number of Lion = 284 + 1270 = 1554.
- The sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Wolf equals the number of Bear.
- Therefore, the number of Bear equals 1554 + 918 = 2472.

**Answer: 2472**<eos>
Define Tiger as U; so U = 802. Define Horse as T; s = U = 802; so T = 925 + s = 925 + 802 = 1727. Define Wolf as e; S = T = 1727; so e = 918 + S = 918 + 1727 = 2645. Define Fox as G; so G = e + T = 2645 + 1727 = 4372. Define Deer as Q; X = G + e = 4372 + 2645 = 7017; so Q = 523 + X = 523 + 7017 = 7540. Define Lion as o; j = Q = 7540; so o = 747 + j = 747 + 7540 = 8287. Define Elephant as m; L = o = 8287; so m = 284 + L = 284 + 8287 = 8571. Define Bear as g; a = m + e = 8571 + 2645 = 11216; so g = 293 + a = 293 + 11216 = 11509. Answer: 11509.

- the number of elephant equals 284 plus the number of lion.
- the number of bear equals 293 plus the sum of the number of elephant and the number of wolf.
- the number of fox equals the sum of the number of wolf and the number of horse.
- the number of horse equals 925 plus the number of tiger.
- the number of lion equals 747 plus the number of deer.
- the number of wolf equals 918 plus the number of horse.
- the number of raccoon equals 696.
- the number of deer equals 523 plus the sum of the number of fox and the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- the number of lion equals 747 plus the number of deer = 747 + 523 = 1270.
- the number of elephant equals 284 plus the number of lion = 284 + 1270 = 1554.
- the sum of the number of elephant and the number of wolf equals the number of bear.
- therefore, the number of bear equals 1554 + 918 = 2472.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Hawk equals 832 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Penguin equals 351 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 640 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Peacock equals the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 636 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 227 plus the number of Peacock.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 668.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Hawk as:
Number of Hawk = 832 + (Number of Crow + Number of Parrot)
- We can also calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = 640 + Number of Hawk
- And the number of Penguin as:
Number of Penguin = 351 + Number of Sparrow
- Substituting the value of Number of Hawk and Number of Sparrow, we get:
Number of Penguin = 351 + (640 + Number of Hawk)
- We can further simplify it as:
Number of Penguin = 351 + 640 + Number of Hawk
- Since the number of Owl equals the number of Parrot, we can write:
Number of Owl = Number of Parrot = 668
- And the number of Crow as:
Number of Crow = 636 + Number of Eagle
- Substituting the value of Number of Eagle, we get:
Number of Crow = 636 + 227 = 863
- Therefore, the number of Hawk is:
Number of Hawk = 832 + (636 + 227) = 1695
- And the number of Penguin is:
Number of Penguin = 351 + 640 + 1695 = 1586

**Answer: 1586**<eos>
Define Parrot as p; so p = 668. Define Owl as R; so R = p = 668. Define Peacock as w; so w = R + p = 668 + 668 = 1336. Define Blue Jay as W; G = w = 1336; so W = 227 + G = 227 + 1336 = 1563. Define Eagle as c; so c = W = 1563. Define Crow as x; X = c = 1563; so x = 636 + X = 636 + 1563 = 2199. Define Hawk as H; n = x + p = 2199 + 668 = 2867; so H = 832 + n = 832 + 2867 = 3699. Define Sparrow as t; a = H = 3699; so t = 640 + a = 640 + 3699 = 4339. Define Penguin as u; h = t = 4339; so u = 351 + h = 351 + 4339 = 4690. Answer: 4690.
**arguments:**

- the number of hawk equals 832 plus the sum of the number of crow and the number of parrot.
- the number of eagle equals the number of blue jay.
- the number of penguin equals 351 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of sparrow equals 640 plus the number of hawk.
- the number of peacock equals the sum of the number of owl and the number of parrot.
- the number of crow equals 636 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of blue jay equals 227 plus the number of peacock.
- the number of owl equals the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 668.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of hawk as:
number of hawk = 832 + (number of crow + number of parrot)
- we can also calculate the number of sparrow as:
number of sparrow = 640 + number of hawk
- and the number of penguin as:
number of penguin = 351 + number of sparrow
- substituting the value of number of hawk and number of sparrow, we get:
number of penguin = 351 + (640 + number of hawk)
- we can further simplify it as:
number of penguin = 351 + 640 + number of hawk
- since the number of owl equals the number of parrot, we can write:
number of owl = number of parrot = 668
- and the number of crow as:
number of crow = 636 + number of eagle
- substituting the value of number of eagle, we get:
number of crow = 636 + 227 = 863
- therefore, the number of hawk is:
number of hawk = 832 + (636 + 227) = 1695
- and the number of penguin is:
number of penguin = 351 + 640 + 1695 = 1586

- The number of Blue Jay = 410 + Crow.
- The number of Sparrow = 541 + Parrot + Blue Jay.
- The number of Crow = 79 + Eagle.
- The number of Owl = Hawk = 863.
- The number of Sparrow = 541 + (410 + Crow) + (410 + Crow) = 1361 + 2*Crow.

**Answer: 1361 + 2*Crow**<eos>
Define Penguin as X; so X = 467. Define Hawk as e; z = X = 467; so e = 396 + z = 396 + 467 = 863. Define Owl as m; so m = e = 863. Define Eagle as o; I = m = 863; so o = 905 + I = 905 + 863 = 1768. Define Crow as J; W = o = 1768; so J = 79 + W = 79 + 1768 = 1847. Define Blue Jay as t; r = J = 1847; so t = 410 + r = 410 + 1847 = 2257. Define Parrot as v; T = t + m = 2257 + 863 = 3120; so v = T + J = 3120 + 1847 = 4967. Define Sparrow as y; x = v + t = 4967 + 2257 = 7224; so y = 541 + x = 541 + 7224 = 7765. Answer: 7765.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Penguin equals 303 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals 930 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Crow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 956 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow equals 799 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Hawk equals 8.
- The number of Parrot equals 438 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Penguin, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Hawk.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Crow, so the number of Blue Jay is also 799.
- The number of Sparrow equals 956 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle, so the number of Eagle is 956 - 799 = 157.
- The number of Eagle equals 930 plus the number of Hawk, so the number of Hawk is 930 - 157 = 773.
- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Penguin, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Hawk, so the number of Owl is 303 + 799 + 773 = 1875.

**Answer: 1875**<eos>
Define Hawk as p; so p = 8. Define Eagle as D; R = p = 8; so D = 930 + R = 930 + 8 = 938. Define Crow as P; C = D + p = 938 + 8 = 946; so P = 799 + C = 799 + 946 = 1745. Define Blue Jay as f; so f = P = 1745. Define Sparrow as T; V = f + D = 1745 + 938 = 2683; so T = 956 + V = 956 + 2683 = 3639. Define Parrot as j; z = T = 3639; so j = 438 + z = 438 + 3639 = 4077. Define Penguin as b; c = j = 4077; so b = 303 + c = 303 + 4077 = 4380. Define Owl as Y; k = b + f = 4380 + 1745 = 6125; so Y = k + p = 6125 + 8 = 6133. Answer: 6133.

- The number of Crow equals 1958 + 889 = 2847.

**Answer: 2847**<eos>
Define Peacock as V; so V = 936. Define Parrot as a; C = V = 936; so a = 898 + C = 898 + 936 = 1834. Define Penguin as R; G = a = 1834; so R = 565 + G = 565 + 1834 = 2399. Define Falcon as y; j = R = 2399; so y = 538 + j = 538 + 2399 = 2937. Define Hawk as h; m = y + R = 2937 + 2399 = 5336; so h = 58 + m = 58 + 5336 = 5394. Define Blue Jay as O; i = h = 5394; so O = 889 + i = 889 + 5394 = 6283. Define Owl as F; so F = O = 6283. Define Eagle as J; H = F + O = 6283 + 6283 = 12566; so J = 180 + H = 180 + 12566 = 12746. Define Crow as w; so w = J + O = 12746 + 6283 = 19029. Answer: 19029.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Tiger equals 476 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Lion equals 616 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 75 plus the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Horse, and the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Horse, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Raccoon equals 697 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Horse equals 856.
- The number of Elephant equals 770 plus the number of Horse.

- Therefore, the number of Wolf equals 697 + 770 + 856 = 2323.
- The number of Deer equals 75 + 2323 = 2498.
- The number of Tiger equals 476 + 616 = 1092.
- The number of Bear equals 1092 + 770 = 1862.

**Answer: 1862**<eos>
Define Horse as T; so T = 856. Define Elephant as n; v = T = 856; so n = 770 + v = 770 + 856 = 1626. Define Raccoon as a; O = n = 1626; so a = 697 + O = 697 + 1626 = 2323. Define Wolf as W; D = a + T = 2323 + 856 = 3179; so W = D + n = 3179 + 1626 = 4805. Define Deer as d; p = W + T = 4805 + 856 = 5661; x = p + n = 5661 + 1626 = 7287; so d = 75 + x = 75 + 7287 = 7362. Define Lion as h; H = d = 7362; so h = 616 + H = 616 + 7362 = 7978. Define Tiger as s; A = h = 7978; so s = 476 + A = 476 + 7978 = 8454. Define Bear as Y; so Y = s + n = 8454 + 1626 = 10080. Answer: 10080.

- The number of Tiger equals 83 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 333 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 826.

Substituting the values we get:

Number of Lion = (83 + 333 + 826) = 1242
Number of Deer = 842 + 1242 = 2084
Number of Wolf = Number of Elephant = 991
Number of Horse = 401 + 991 = 1392
Number of Raccoon = Number of Horse = 1392
Number of Bear = 333 + 826 = 1159
Number of Fox = 826

**Answer: 1392**<eos>
Define Fox as k; so k = 826. Define Bear as O; n = k = 826; so O = 333 + n = 333 + 826 = 1159. Define Tiger as P; Y = O + k = 1159 + 826 = 1985; so P = 83 + Y = 83 + 1985 = 2068. Define Lion as v; A = P + k = 2068 + 826 = 2894; so v = A + O = 2894 + 1159 = 4053. Define Deer as t; a = v = 4053; so t = 842 + a = 842 + 4053 = 4895. Define Elephant as c; N = t = 4895; so c = 991 + N = 991 + 4895 = 5886. Define Wolf as b; so b = c = 5886. Define Horse as S; M = b = 5886; so S = 401 + M = 401 + 5886 = 6287. Define Raccoon as X; so X = S = 6287. Answer: 6287.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Fox, and the number of Horse.
- The number of Raccoon equals 72 plus the number of Horse.
- The number of Deer equals 105 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Elephant equals 562.
- The number of Bear equals 342 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Horse equals 931 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Lion.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Tiger equals 283 plus the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Lion = Bear + Fox + Horse = 342 + Fox + 931 + Elephant
- The number of Raccoon = 72 + Horse
- The number of Deer = 105 + Lion
- The number of Wolf = Deer + Lion
- The number of Fox = Raccoon
- The number of Tiger = 283 + Wolf

Substituting the number of Elephant (562) and solving for Fox:

- 342 + Fox + 931 + 562 = Fox + 1813
- Fox = 1813 - 342 - 931 - 562 = 386

Substituting the value of Fox into the equation for Lion:

- Lion = 342 + 386 + 931 = 1659

Substituting the value of Fox into the equation for Wolf:

- Wolf = Deer + Lion = 105 + 1659 = 1764

Substituting the value of Wolf into the equation for Tiger:

- Tiger = 283 + 1764 = 2047

**Answer: 2047**<eos>
Define Elephant as a; so a = 562. Define Horse as h; J = a = 562; so h = 931 + J = 931 + 562 = 1493. Define Raccoon as j; W = h = 1493; so j = 72 + W = 72 + 1493 = 1565. Define Fox as n; so n = j = 1565. Define Bear as b; Q = n = 1565; so b = 342 + Q = 342 + 1565 = 1907. Define Lion as w; R = b + n = 1907 + 1565 = 3472; so w = R + h = 3472 + 1493 = 4965. Define Deer as c; v = w = 4965; so c = 105 + v = 105 + 4965 = 5070. Define Wolf as T; so T = c + w = 5070 + 4965 = 10035. Define Tiger as g; x = T = 10035; so g = 283 + x = 283 + 10035 = 10318. Answer: 10318.
**arguments:**

- the number of lion equals the sum of the number of bear, the number of fox, and the number of horse.
- the number of raccoon equals 72 plus the number of horse.
- the number of deer equals 105 plus the number of lion.
- the number of elephant equals 562.
- the number of bear equals 342 plus the number of fox.
- the number of horse equals 931 plus the number of elephant.
- the number of wolf equals the sum of the number of deer and the number of lion.
- the number of fox equals the number of raccoon.
- the number of tiger equals 283 plus the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- the number of lion = bear + fox + horse = 342 + fox + 931 + elephant
- the number of raccoon = 72 + horse
- the number of deer = 105 + lion
- the number of wolf = deer + lion
- the number of fox = raccoon
- the number of tiger = 283 + wolf

substituting the number of elephant (562) and solving for fox:

- 342 + fox + 931 + 562 = fox + 1813
- fox = 1813 - 342 - 931 - 562 = 386

substituting the value of fox into the equation for lion:

- lion = 342 + 386 + 931 = 1659

substituting the value of fox into the equation for wolf:

- wolf = deer + lion = 105 + 1659 = 1764

substituting the value of wolf into the equation for tiger:

- tiger = 283 + 1764 = 2047

- The number of Peacock equals 879 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 522 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 438 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Hawk equals 9.

Substituting the above equations, we get:

Number of Sparrow = Number of Blue Jay
= Penguin + Crow + Eagle + Peacock
= (897 + Crow) + (Peacock + Owl) + 438 + Hawk
= (897 + Crow) + (879 + Owl) + 438 + 9
= 2213 + Crow + Owl

**Answer: 2213**<eos>
Define Hawk as y; so y = 9. Define Eagle as d; T = y = 9; so d = 438 + T = 438 + 9 = 447. Define Owl as v; C = d = 447; so v = 522 + C = 522 + 447 = 969. Define Peacock as G; P = v = 969; so G = 879 + P = 879 + 969 = 1848. Define Crow as t; B = G + v = 1848 + 969 = 2817; so t = B + y = 2817 + 9 = 2826. Define Penguin as E; f = t = 2826; so E = 897 + f = 897 + 2826 = 3723. Define Blue Jay as W; j = E + t = 3723 + 2826 = 6549; u = j + d = 6549 + 447 = 6996; so W = u + G = 6996 + 1848 = 8844. Define Sparrow as Z; so Z = W = 8844. Answer: 8844.

= penguin + crow + eagle + peacock
= (897 + crow) + (peacock + owl) + 438 + hawk
= (897 + crow) + (879 + owl) + 438 + 9
= 2213 + crow + owl

**answer: 2213**<eos>

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Owl equals the number of Blue Jay. Therefore, the number of Owl = the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Hawk equals 59 plus the number of Parrot. We don't have any information about the number of Parrot, so we cannot calculate the number of Hawk.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 232 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Peacock. We don't have any information about the number of Penguin or Peacock, so we cannot calculate the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Sparrow equals the number of Crow. We don't have any information about the number of Crow, so we cannot calculate the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Owl. We don't have any information about the number of Eagle, Sparrow, or Owl, so we cannot calculate the number of Parrot.
- The number of Penguin equals 340 plus the number of Peacock. We don't have any information about the number of Peacock, so we cannot calculate the number of Penguin.
- The number of Peacock equals 926.

**Answer: Cannot be determined**<eos>
Define Peacock as h; so h = 926. Define Penguin as I; j = h = 926; so I = 340 + j = 340 + 926 = 1266. Define Blue Jay as b; g = I + h = 1266 + 926 = 2192; so b = 232 + g = 232 + 2192 = 2424. Define Owl as Z; so Z = b = 2424. Define Crow as H; O = Z = 2424; so H = 180 + O = 180 + 2424 = 2604. Define Sparrow as Q; so Q = H = 2604. Define Eagle as n; p = Q = 2604; so n = 719 + p = 719 + 2604 = 3323. Define Parrot as C; N = n + Q = 3323 + 2604 = 5927; so C = N + Z = 5927 + 2424 = 8351. Define Hawk as B; v = C = 8351; so B = 59 + v = 59 + 8351 = 8410. Answer: 8410.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals the number of Peacock.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Hawk equals 428 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Eagle equals 323.
- The number of Peacock equals 375 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Penguin equals 849 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, the number of Penguin, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Owl equals 49 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Peacock.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Sparrow equals the number of Peacock, so let's assume both are x.
- The number of Crow is equal to the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Eagle. We know that the number of Hawk equals 428 plus the number of Parrot, and the number of Eagle equals 323. Therefore, the number of Crow can be written as:
Crow = Hawk + Eagle
Crow = (428 + Parrot) + 323
Crow = 751 + Parrot
- We also know that the number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, the number of Penguin, and the number of Sparrow. We can substitute the values we know to get:
Parrot = Owl + Eagle + Penguin + Sparrow
Parrot = (49 + Penguin) + 323 + 849 + x
Parrot = 1211 + x + Penguin
- Now we can substitute the expression for Parrot into the equation for Crow to get:
Crow = 751 + (1211 + x + Penguin)
Crow = 1962 + x + Penguin
- We don't have any information about the number of Penguin, so we can't calculate the exact number of Crow. However, we can leave the answer in terms of x and Penguin.

**Answer: 1962 + x + Penguin**<eos>
Define Eagle as V; so V = 323. Define Peacock as D; s = V = 323; so D = 375 + s = 375 + 323 = 698. Define Sparrow as n; so n = D = 698. Define Blue Jay as d; so d = n + D = 698 + 698 = 1396. Define Penguin as Q; I = d = 1396; so Q = 849 + I = 849 + 1396 = 2245. Define Owl as P; q = Q = 2245; so P = 49 + q = 49 + 2245 = 2294. Define Parrot as r; y = P + V = 2294 + 323 = 2617; S = y + Q = 2617 + 2245 = 4862; so r = S + n = 4862 + 698 = 5560. Define Hawk as z; x = r = 5560; so z = 428 + x = 428 + 5560 = 5988. Define Crow as b; so b = z + V = 5988 + 323 = 6311. Answer: 6311.
**arguments:**

- the number of sparrow equals the number of peacock.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of hawk and the number of eagle.
- the number of hawk equals 428 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of eagle equals 323.
- the number of peacock equals 375 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of penguin equals 849 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of parrot equals the sum of the number of owl, the number of eagle, the number of penguin, and the number of sparrow.
- the number of owl equals 49 plus the number of penguin.
- the number of blue jay equals the sum of the number of sparrow and the number of peacock.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we know that the number of sparrow equals the number of peacock, so let's assume both are x.
- the number of crow is equal to the sum of the number of hawk and the number of eagle. we know that the number of hawk equals 428 plus the number of parrot, and the number of eagle equals 323. therefore, the number of crow can be written as:
crow = hawk + eagle
crow = (428 + parrot) + 323
crow = 751 + parrot
- we also know that the number of parrot equals the sum of the number of owl, the number of eagle, the number of penguin, and the number of sparrow. we can substitute the values we know to get:
parrot = owl + eagle + penguin + sparrow
parrot = (49 + penguin) + 323 + 849 + x
parrot = 1211 + x + penguin
- now we can substitute the expression for parrot into the equation for crow to get:
crow = 751 + (1211 + x + penguin)
crow = 1962 + x + penguin
- we don't have any information about the number of penguin, so we can't calculate the exact number of crow. however, we can leave the answer in terms of x and penguin.

**answer: 1962 + x + penguin**<eos>

- The number of Wolf equals 170 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals 405 plus the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the number of Bear and Deer:**
   - Since the number of Bear equals the number of Deer, let's assume both are x.
   - Therefore, x = x.


2. **Calculate the number of Elephant:**
   - The number of Elephant equals 702 plus the number of Fox.
   - Since the number of Fox equals 153, the number of Elephant equals 702 + 153 = 855.


3. **Calculate the number of Tiger and Lion:**
   - The number of Tiger equals 19 plus the number of Lion.
   - The number of Lion equals 426 plus the number of Bear.
   - Substituting the value of Bear from step 1, we get:
     - The number of Tiger equals 19 + (426 + x) = 445 + x.
     - The number of Lion equals 426 + x.


4. **Calculate the number of Raccoon:**
   - The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Lion, the number of Fox, and the number of Elephant.
   - Substituting the values from steps 2-3, we get:
     - The number of Raccoon equals (445 + x) + (426 + x) + 153 + 855 = 1659 + 2x.


5. **Calculate the number of Wolf:**
   - The number of Wolf equals 170 plus the number of Raccoon.
   - Substituting the value of Raccoon from step 4, we get:
     - The number of Wolf equals 170 + (1659 + 2x) = 1829 + 2x.


**Answer: 1829 + 2x**<eos>
Define Fox as j; so j = 153. Define Elephant as n; g = j = 153; so n = 702 + g = 702 + 153 = 855. Define Deer as p; Q = n = 855; so p = 405 + Q = 405 + 855 = 1260. Define Bear as B; so B = p = 1260. Define Lion as v; J = B = 1260; so v = 426 + J = 426 + 1260 = 1686. Define Tiger as E; r = v = 1686; so E = 19 + r = 19 + 1686 = 1705. Define Raccoon as b; N = E + v = 1705 + 1686 = 3391; U = N + j = 3391 + 153 = 3544; so b = U + n = 3544 + 855 = 4399. Define Wolf as I; y = b = 4399; so I = 170 + y = 170 + 4399 = 4569. Answer: 4569.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 659 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk equals 894 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Penguin equals 86.
- The number of Eagle equals 11 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Parrot, the number of Penguin, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 191 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow equals 798 plus the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Sparrow as follows:
Number of Sparrow = Number of Owl = Number of Sparrow
Therefore, the number of Sparrow is 659 + Number of Owl.
- We can also calculate the number of Hawk as follows:
Number of Hawk = 894 + Number of Crow
- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Parrot as follows:
Number of Parrot = 191 + Number of Eagle
- We can calculate the number of Crow as follows:
Number of Crow = 798 + Number of Parrot
- Substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of Blue Jay, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 659 + (Number of Owl + Number of Sparrow)
= 659 + (Number of Owl + 659 + Number of Owl)
= 659 + 2 * Number of Owl + 659
= 1318 + 2 * Number of Owl
- We cannot calculate the number of Blue Jay without knowing the number of Owl.

**Answer: Cannot be determined**<eos>
Define Penguin as v; so v = 86. Define Eagle as a; w = v = 86; so a = 11 + w = 11 + 86 = 97. Define Parrot as n; c = a = 97; so n = 191 + c = 191 + 97 = 288. Define Crow as I; S = n = 288; so I = 798 + S = 798 + 288 = 1086. Define Hawk as h; m = I = 1086; so h = 894 + m = 894 + 1086 = 1980. Define Sparrow as s; A = h + n = 1980 + 288 = 2268; W = A + v = 2268 + 86 = 2354; so s = W + I = 2354 + 1086 = 3440. Define Owl as o; so o = s = 3440. Define Blue Jay as C; H = o + s = 3440 + 3440 = 6880; so C = 659 + H = 659 + 6880 = 7539. Answer: 7539.
**arguments:**

- the number of blue jay equals 659 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of sparrow.
- the number of hawk equals 894 plus the number of crow.
- the number of owl equals the number of sparrow.
- the number of penguin equals 86.
- the number of eagle equals 11 plus the number of penguin.
- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of hawk, the number of parrot, the number of penguin, and the number of crow.
- the number of parrot equals 191 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of crow equals 798 plus the number of parrot.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of sparrow as follows:
number of sparrow = number of owl = number of sparrow
therefore, the number of sparrow is 659 + number of owl.
- we can also calculate the number of hawk as follows:
number of hawk = 894 + number of crow
- from the given information, we can calculate the number of parrot as follows:
number of parrot = 191 + number of eagle
- we can calculate the number of crow as follows:
number of crow = 798 + number of parrot
- substituting the above equations into the equation for the number of blue jay, we get:
number of blue jay = 659 + (number of owl + number of sparrow)
= 659 + (number of owl + 659 + number of owl)
= 659 + 2 * number of owl + 659
= 1318 + 2 * number of owl
- we cannot calculate the number of blue jay without knowing the number of owl.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 858.
- The number of Owl equals 302 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Eagle equals 810 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 792 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Penguin equals 616.
- The number of Sparrow equals 321 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Peacock equals the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot equals 968 plus the sum of the number of Peacock, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Hawk = Parrot + Sparrow + Blue Jay = Parrot + 321 + 858 = Parrot + 1179.
- The number of Owl = 302 + Hawk = 302 + (Parrot + 1179) = 1481 + Parrot.
- The number of Eagle = 810 + Owl = 810 + (1481 + Parrot) = 2291 + Parrot.
- The number of Crow = 792 + Eagle = 792 + (2291 + Parrot) = 3083 + Parrot.

**Answer: 3083 + Parrot**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as w; so w = 858. Define Sparrow as n; t = w = 858; so n = 321 + t = 321 + 858 = 1179. Define Peacock as i; so i = n = 1179. Define Parrot as z; a = i + w = 1179 + 858 = 2037; B = a + n = 2037 + 1179 = 3216; so z = 968 + B = 968 + 3216 = 4184. Define Hawk as G; F = z + n = 4184 + 1179 = 5363; so G = F + w = 5363 + 858 = 6221. Define Owl as T; o = G = 6221; so T = 302 + o = 302 + 6221 = 6523. Define Eagle as v; q = T = 6523; so v = 810 + q = 810 + 6523 = 7333. Define Crow as j; S = v = 7333; so j = 792 + S = 792 + 7333 = 8125. Answer: 8125.

- the number of hawk equals the sum of the number of parrot, the number of sparrow, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals 858.
- the number of owl equals 302 plus the number of hawk.
- the number of eagle equals 810 plus the number of owl.
- the number of crow equals 792 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of penguin equals 616.
- the number of sparrow equals 321 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of peacock equals the number of sparrow.
- the number of parrot equals 968 plus the sum of the number of peacock, the number of blue jay, and the number of sparrow.

**calculation:**

- the number of hawk = parrot + sparrow + blue jay = parrot + 321 + 858 = parrot + 1179.
- the number of owl = 302 + hawk = 302 + (parrot + 1179) = 1481 + parrot.
- the number of eagle = 810 + owl = 810 + (1481 + parrot) = 2291 + parrot.
- the number of crow = 792 + eagle = 792 + (2291 + parrot) = 3083 + parrot.

- The number of Raccoon is 69 + 1926 + 890 = 2895.
- The number of Fox is 2895 + 890 = 3785.

**Answer: 3785**<eos>
Define Wolf as s; so s = 890. Define Elephant as W; r = s = 890; so W = 479 + r = 479 + 890 = 1369. Define Lion as e; B = W + s = 1369 + 890 = 2259; so e = 647 + B = 647 + 2259 = 2906. Define Deer as J; R = e = 2906; so J = 800 + R = 800 + 2906 = 3706. Define Bear as Y; a = J = 3706; so Y = 804 + a = 804 + 3706 = 4510. Define Tiger as k; i = Y = 4510; so k = 322 + i = 322 + 4510 = 4832. Define Raccoon as X; y = k + s = 4832 + 890 = 5722; E = y + Y = 5722 + 4510 = 10232; so X = 69 + E = 69 + 10232 = 10301. Define Fox as D; so D = X + s = 10301 + 890 = 11191. Answer: 11191.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Lion equals 114 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Lion, the number of Horse, and the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Tiger equals 861 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Elephant equals 174 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals the number of Elephant.
- The number of Deer equals 600 plus the number of Horse.
- The number of Horse equals 438.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Lion = 114 + Deer
- The number of Wolf = Tiger + Lion + Horse + Deer
- The number of Bear = Fox
- The number of Fox = Raccoon
- The number of Tiger = 861 + Lion
- The number of Elephant = 174 + Wolf
- The number of Raccoon = Elephant
- The number of Deer = 600 + Horse
- The number of Horse = 438

Substituting the value of Horse into the equation for Deer:
The number of Deer = 600 + 438 = 1038

Substituting the value of Lion into the equation for Wolf:
The number of Wolf = Tiger + Lion + Horse + Deer
= 861 + 114 + 438 + 1038
= 2451

Substituting the value of Raccoon into the equation for Fox:
The number of Fox = Raccoon
= 2451

Substituting the value of Fox into the equation for Bear:
The number of Bear = Fox
= 2451

**Answer: 2451**<eos>
Define Horse as F; so F = 438. Define Deer as E; V = F = 438; so E = 600 + V = 600 + 438 = 1038. Define Lion as O; v = E = 1038; so O = 114 + v = 114 + 1038 = 1152. Define Tiger as z; A = O = 1152; so z = 861 + A = 861 + 1152 = 2013. Define Wolf as L; p = z + O = 2013 + 1152 = 3165; J = p + F = 3165 + 438 = 3603; so L = J + E = 3603 + 1038 = 4641. Define Elephant as r; M = L = 4641; so r = 174 + M = 174 + 4641 = 4815. Define Raccoon as u; so u = r = 4815. Define Fox as I; so I = u = 4815. Define Bear as h; so h = I = 4815. Answer: 4815.

- the number of elephant equals 174 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of raccoon equals the number of elephant.
- the number of deer equals 600 plus the number of horse.
- the number of horse equals 438.

**calculation:**

- the number of lion = 114 + deer
- the number of wolf = tiger + lion + horse + deer
- the number of bear = fox
- the number of fox = raccoon
- the number of tiger = 861 + lion
- the number of elephant = 174 + wolf
- the number of raccoon = elephant
- the number of deer = 600 + horse

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Crow, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Peacock.
- The number of Owl equals 612 plus the number of Peacock.
- The number of Penguin equals 760 plus the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Peacock, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 524 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 514.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 287 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Peacock, and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Peacock equals 952 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Sparrow = Owl + Crow + Blue Jay + Peacock
Sparrow = (612 + Peacock) + Crow + (287 + Hawk) + Peacock
Sparrow = 899 + 2 * Peacock + Hawk

- We also know that the number of Crow equals the number of Blue Jay, so:
Crow = Blue Jay = 287 + Hawk

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Penguin as:
Penguin = 760 + Crow + Peacock + Parrot
Penguin = 760 + (287 + Hawk) + Peacock + Parrot

- We can substitute the expression for Crow and Parrot in terms of Peacock and Hawk into the equation for Penguin:
Penguin = 760 + (287 + Hawk) + 952 + Parrot + Hawk
Penguin = 1999 + 2 * Hawk + Parrot

- We can further substitute the expression for Parrot in terms of Hawk:
Penguin = 1999 + 2 * Hawk + (524 + Hawk)
Penguin = 2523 + 3 * Hawk

**Answer: 2523**<eos>
Define Eagle as Y; so Y = 514. Define Parrot as m; E = Y = 514; so m = 524 + E = 524 + 514 = 1038. Define Peacock as w; A = m = 1038; so w = 952 + A = 952 + 1038 = 1990. Define Owl as b; d = w = 1990; so b = 612 + d = 612 + 1990 = 2602. Define Hawk as J; I = b + w = 2602 + 1990 = 4592; so J = I + m = 4592 + 1038 = 5630. Define Blue Jay as l; j = J = 5630; so l = 287 + j = 287 + 5630 = 5917. Define Crow as Q; so Q = l = 5917. Define Penguin as M; V = Q + w = 5917 + 1990 = 7907; K = V + m = 7907 + 1038 = 8945; so M = 760 + K = 760 + 8945 = 9705. Answer: 9705.

- Therefore, the number of Penguin = 1414 + 2 * Peacock.

**Answer: Answer: 1414 + 2 * Peacock**<eos>
Define Sparrow as Z; so Z = 298. Define Hawk as s; X = Z = 298; so s = 899 + X = 899 + 298 = 1197. Define Peacock as u; so u = s = 1197. Define Blue Jay as L; A = u = 1197; so L = 401 + A = 401 + 1197 = 1598. Define Parrot as i; e = L = 1598; so i = 629 + e = 629 + 1598 = 2227. Define Crow as z; N = i = 2227; so z = 715 + N = 715 + 2227 = 2942. Define Owl as F; q = z + L = 2942 + 1598 = 4540; m = q + Z = 4540 + 298 = 4838; so F = m + u = 4838 + 1197 = 6035. Define Penguin as V; w = F + u = 6035 + 1197 = 7232; so V = w + Z = 7232 + 298 = 7530. Answer: 7530.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 961.
- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of crow, the number of blue jay, the number of sparrow, and the number of peacock.
- the number of peacock equals the number of hawk.
- the number of blue jay equals 401 plus the number of peacock.
- the number of sparrow equals 298.
- the number of penguin equals the sum of the number of owl, the number of peacock, and the number of sparrow.
- the number of crow equals 715 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of hawk equals 899 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of parrot equals 629 plus the number of blue jay.

**calculation:**

- the number of owl = crow + blue jay + sparrow + peacock = 715 + 401 + 298 + peacock.
- the number of peacock = hawk = 899 + sparrow.
- the number of blue jay = 401 + peacock.
- the number of penguin = owl + peacock + sparrow = (715 + 401 + 298 + peacock) + peacock + 298.
- therefore, the number of penguin = 1414 + 2 * peacock.

**answer: answer: 1414 + 2 * peacock**<eos>

Answer the questions below. Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated. Problem: The number of Tiger equals the number of Horse.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals the number of Horse.
- The number of Wolf equals 268 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Fox equals 546 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Horse equals the sum of the number of Deer, the number of Wolf, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Deer equals 399 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals 25 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Lion equals 342.
- The number of Bear equals 828 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can deduce that:
    - The number of Tiger = the number of Horse = x
    - The number of Wolf = 268 + Raccoon
    - The number of Fox = 546 + Elephant
    - The number of Horse = Deer + Wolf + Raccoon
    - The number of Deer = 399 + Wolf
    - The number of Raccoon = 25 + Lion
    - The number of Lion = 342
    - The number of Bear = 828 + Tiger
    - The number of Elephant = Bear + Wolf

- We can substitute the expressions for the number of animals in terms of each other to get:
    - x = x
    - Wolf = 268 + Raccoon
    - Fox = 546 + (Bear + Wolf)
    - x = 399 + Wolf + Raccoon
    - Raccoon = 25 + Lion
    - Lion = 342
    - Bear = 828 + x
    - Elephant = Bear + Wolf

- We can solve for the number of Fox by substituting the expressions for the other animals:
    - Fox = 546 + (828 + x + 268 + Raccoon)
    - Fox = 546 + 1096 + Raccoon
    - Fox = 1642 + Raccoon

**Answer: 1642 + Raccoon**<eos>
Define Lion as S; so S = 342. Define Raccoon as G; Y = S = 342; so G = 25 + Y = 25 + 342 = 367. Define Wolf as i; c = G = 367; so i = 268 + c = 268 + 367 = 635. Define Deer as a; l = i = 635; so a = 399 + l = 399 + 635 = 1034. Define Horse as w; B = a + i = 1034 + 635 = 1669; so w = B + G = 1669 + 367 = 2036. Define Tiger as F; so F = w = 2036. Define Bear as h; M = F = 2036; so h = 828 + M = 828 + 2036 = 2864. Define Elephant as b; so b = h + i = 2864 + 635 = 3499. Define Fox as N; T = b = 3499; so N = 546 + T = 546 + 3499 = 4045. Answer: 4045.

- the number of lion equals 342.
- the number of bear equals 828 plus the number of tiger.
- the number of elephant equals the sum of the number of bear and the number of wolf.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can deduce that:
    - the number of tiger = the number of horse = x
    - the number of wolf = 268 + raccoon
    - the number of fox = 546 + elephant
    - the number of horse = deer + wolf + raccoon
    - the number of deer = 399 + wolf
    - the number of raccoon = 25 + lion
    - the number of lion = 342
    - the number of bear = 828 + tiger
    - the number of elephant = bear + wolf

- we can substitute the expressions for the number of animals in terms of each other to get:
    - x = x
    - wolf = 268 + raccoon
    - fox = 546 + (bear + wolf)
    - x = 399 + wolf + raccoon
    - raccoon = 25 + lion
    - lion = 342

- The number of Crow equals 400.
- The number of Eagle equals 663 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Sparrow = 665 + Parrot = 665 + 634 = 1299
- The number of Parrot = 634
- The number of Crow = 400
- The number of Owl = 865 + Hawk
- The number of Blue Jay = 12 + Sparrow + Crow + Parrot = 12 + 1299 + 400 + 634 = 2455
- The number of Penguin = Owl + Hawk + Sparrow = 865 + Hawk + 1299
- The number of Eagle = 663 + Penguin = 663 + 865 + Hawk + 1299
- The number of Hawk = Blue Jay = 2455

**Answer: Eagle = 663 + 865 + 2455 = 1783**<eos>
Define Crow as t; so t = 400. Define Parrot as x; m = t = 400; so x = 634 + m = 634 + 400 = 1034. Define Sparrow as F; X = x = 1034; so F = 665 + X = 665 + 1034 = 1699. Define Blue Jay as Y; N = F + t = 1699 + 400 = 2099; f = N + x = 2099 + 1034 = 3133; so Y = 12 + f = 12 + 3133 = 3145. Define Hawk as d; so d = Y = 3145. Define Owl as H; R = d = 3145; so H = 865 + R = 865 + 3145 = 4010. Define Penguin as P; j = H + d = 4010 + 3145 = 7155; so P = j + F = 7155 + 1699 = 8854. Define Eagle as K; h = P = 8854; so K = 663 + h = 663 + 8854 = 9517. Answer: 9517.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals 448 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals 395 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Owl equals 297 plus the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- From the first equation, we have: Number of Eagle = 448 + Number of Parrot
- From the third equation, we have: Number of Sparrow = 297 + Number of Sparrow
- Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get: Number of Eagle = 448 + (395 + Number of Owl)
- Substituting the third equation into the above equation, we get: Number of Eagle = 448 + (395 + (297 + Number of Sparrow))
- Simplifying, we get: Number of Eagle = 448 + 692 + Number of Sparrow
- Therefore, Number of Eagle = 1140 + Number of Sparrow

**Answer: 1140 + Number of Sparrow**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as U; so U = 975. Define Penguin as K; r = U = 975; so K = 568 + r = 568 + 975 = 1543. Define Crow as a; s = K + U = 1543 + 975 = 2518; so a = 782 + s = 782 + 2518 = 3300. Define Hawk as i; V = a + K = 3300 + 1543 = 4843; so i = 515 + V = 515 + 4843 = 5358. Define Sparrow as b; E = i = 5358; so b = 179 + E = 179 + 5358 = 5537. Define Owl as H; S = b = 5537; so H = 297 + S = 297 + 5537 = 5834. Define Parrot as h; c = H + b = 5834 + 5537 = 11371; so h = 395 + c = 395 + 11371 = 11766. Define Eagle as d; A = h = 11766; so d = 448 + A = 448 + 11766 = 12214. Answer: 12214.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals 448 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of parrot equals 395 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of sparrow.
- the number of owl equals 297 plus the number of sparrow.

**calculation:**

- from the first equation, we have: number of eagle = 448 + number of parrot
- from the third equation, we have: number of sparrow = 297 + number of sparrow
- substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get: number of eagle = 448 + (395 + number of owl)
- substituting the third equation into the above equation, we get: number of eagle = 448 + (395 + (297 + number of sparrow))
- simplifying, we get: number of eagle = 448 + 692 + number of sparrow
- therefore, number of eagle = 1140 + number of sparrow

**Answer: 864**<eos>
Define Sparrow as c; so c = 864. Define Owl as e; T = c = 864; so e = 731 + T = 731 + 864 = 1595. Define Hawk as w; h = e + c = 1595 + 864 = 2459; so w = 911 + h = 911 + 2459 = 3370. Define Penguin as H; so H = w = 3370. Define Crow as J; R = H = 3370; so J = 63 + R = 63 + 3370 = 3433. Define Peacock as M; L = J + H = 3433 + 3370 = 6803; so M = L + c = 6803 + 864 = 7667. Define Eagle as s; j = M = 7667; so s = 851 + j = 851 + 7667 = 8518. Define Blue Jay as E; S = s = 8518; so E = 313 + S = 313 + 8518 = 8831. Define Parrot as W; so W = E = 8831. Answer: 8831.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the number of Wolf.
- The number of Lion equals 12 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Wolf equals 667 plus the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Tiger, and the number of Lion.
- The number of Bear equals 643 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Tiger equals 475 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Raccoon equals 215.
- The number of Fox equals 91 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Lion.
- The number of Elephant equals 699 plus the number of Raccoon.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf is equal to the number of Deer, which is also equal to the number of Wolf. Therefore, the number of Wolf is 667.
- The number of Lion is 12 plus the number of Elephant. Therefore, the number of Lion is 12 + 699 = 711.
- The number of Fox is 91 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Lion. Therefore, the number of Fox is 91 + (667 + 711) = 91 + 1378 = 1469.

**Answer: 1469**<eos>
Define Raccoon as g; so g = 215. Define Elephant as I; U = g = 215; so I = 699 + U = 699 + 215 = 914. Define Lion as m; C = I = 914; so m = 12 + C = 12 + 914 = 926. Define Tiger as x; i = m = 926; so x = 475 + i = 475 + 926 = 1401. Define Bear as s; b = x = 1401; so s = 643 + b = 643 + 1401 = 2044. Define Wolf as A; r = s + x = 2044 + 1401 = 3445; D = r + m = 3445 + 926 = 4371; so A = 667 + D = 667 + 4371 = 5038. Define Deer as c; so c = A = 5038. Define Fox as w; y = c + m = 5038 + 926 = 5964; so w = 91 + y = 91 + 5964 = 6055. Answer: 6055.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the number of wolf.
- the number of lion equals 12 plus the number of elephant.
- the number of wolf equals 667 plus the sum of the number of bear, the number of tiger, and the number of lion.

- The number of Horse equals 812 + number of Elephant = 812 + (571 + 499) = 1982.

**Answer: 1982**<eos>
Define Fox as N; so N = 828. Define Lion as K; q = N = 828; so K = 513 + q = 513 + 828 = 1341. Define Raccoon as k; z = K = 1341; so k = 333 + z = 333 + 1341 = 1674. Define Deer as Y; so Y = k = 1674. Define Bear as G; x = Y + K = 1674 + 1341 = 3015; o = x + k = 3015 + 1674 = 4689; so G = 631 + o = 631 + 4689 = 5320. Define Tiger as X; s = G = 5320; so X = 499 + s = 499 + 5320 = 5819. Define Elephant as Q; C = X = 5819; so Q = 571 + C = 571 + 5819 = 6390. Define Horse as h; f = Q = 6390; so h = 812 + f = 812 + 6390 = 7202. Answer: 7202.

- The number of Owl = 375 + 1517 = 1892
- The number of Sparrow = 659 + 959 + 1892 = 3450

**Answer: 3450**<eos>
Define Hawk as m; so m = 586. Define Penguin as G; X = m = 586; so G = 897 + X = 897 + 586 = 1483. Define Crow as w; B = G + m = 1483 + 586 = 2069; so w = 33 + B = 33 + 2069 = 2102. Define Blue Jay as h; q = w = 2102; so h = 756 + q = 756 + 2102 = 2858. Define Eagle as K; N = h = 2858; so K = 142 + N = 142 + 2858 = 3000. Define Owl as c; n = K = 3000; so c = 375 + n = 375 + 3000 = 3375. Define Parrot as k; e = c + K = 3375 + 3000 = 6375; so k = 584 + e = 584 + 6375 = 6959. Define Sparrow as a; D = k + c = 6959 + 3375 = 10334; so a = 659 + D = 659 + 10334 = 10993. Answer: 10993.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Raccoon equals 374 plus the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Elephant = 374 + x (where x is the number of Elephant)
- The number of Fox = Raccoon + Elephant = 374 + x + Elephant
- The number of Deer = Fox + Raccoon = (374 + x + Elephant) + Raccoon
- Therefore, the number of Deer = (374 + x + Elephant) + 374 = 748 + x + Elephant

**Answer: 748 + x + Elephant**<eos>
Define Lion as g; so g = 486. Define Horse as o; i = g = 486; so o = 965 + i = 965 + 486 = 1451. Define Kangaroo as k; B = o = 1451; so k = 88 + B = 88 + 1451 = 1539. Define Tiger as c; h = k + g = 1539 + 486 = 2025; so c = h + o = 2025 + 1451 = 3476. Define Bear as v; l = c + g = 3476 + 486 = 3962; so v = l + k = 3962 + 1539 = 5501. Define Elephant as x; u = v = 5501; so x = 988 + u = 988 + 5501 = 6489. Define Raccoon as n; z = x = 6489; so n = 374 + z = 374 + 6489 = 6863. Define Fox as H; so H = n + x = 6863 + 6489 = 13352. Define Deer as P; so P = H + n = 13352 + 6863 = 20215. Answer: 20215.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of fox and the number of raccoon.
- the number of fox equals the sum of the number of raccoon and the number of elephant.
- the number of raccoon equals 374 plus the number of elephant.

**calculation:**

- the number of elephant = 374 + x (where x is the number of elephant)
- the number of fox = raccoon + elephant = 374 + x + elephant
- the number of deer = fox + raccoon = (374 + x + elephant) + raccoon
- therefore, the number of deer = (374 + x + elephant) + 374 = 748 + x + elephant

**answer: 748 + x + elephant**<eos>

- The number of Raccoon is equal to 286 + the number of Deer, which is 286 + 1626 = 1912.
- The number of Elephant is equal to 498 + the number of Raccoon, which is 498 + 1912 = 2410.

**Answer: 2410**<eos>
Define Tiger as u; so u = 913. Define Fox as d; O = u = 913; so d = 267 + O = 267 + 913 = 1180. Define Bear as e; L = d = 1180; so e = 361 + L = 361 + 1180 = 1541. Define Lion as M; so M = e = 1541. Define Wolf as P; X = M + u = 1541 + 913 = 2454; so P = X + e = 2454 + 1541 = 3995. Define Deer as h; A = P + M = 3995 + 1541 = 5536; z = A + d = 5536 + 1180 = 6716; so h = 87 + z = 87 + 6716 = 6803. Define Raccoon as E; I = h = 6803; so E = 286 + I = 286 + 6803 = 7089. Define Elephant as w; K = E = 7089; so w = 498 + K = 498 + 7089 = 7587. Answer: 7587.

- The number of Elephant = 543 + 759 = 1302
- The number of Raccoon = 630
- The number of Lion = 1302 + 630 = 1932
- The number of Horse = 789 + 630 = 1419
- The number of Wolf = 1419 + 573 + 630 = 2622
- The number of Tiger = 573
- The number of Fox = 2622 + 573 + 1302 = 3597

**Answer: 3597**<eos>
Define Tiger as e; so e = 573. Define Deer as h; so h = e = 573. Define Bear as y; i = h = 573; so y = 759 + i = 759 + 573 = 1332. Define Elephant as Y; c = y = 1332; so Y = 543 + c = 543 + 1332 = 1875. Define Lion as X; so X = Y + h = 1875 + 573 = 2448. Define Raccoon as s; H = X = 2448; so s = 630 + H = 630 + 2448 = 3078. Define Horse as T; Q = s = 3078; so T = 789 + Q = 789 + 3078 = 3867. Define Wolf as U; m = T + h = 3867 + 573 = 4440; so U = m + s = 4440 + 3078 = 7518. Define Fox as I; t = U + e = 7518 + 573 = 8091; so I = t + Y = 8091 + 1875 = 9966. Answer: 9966.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Kangaroo equals the number of Horse.
- The number of Horse equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Bear, and the number of Tiger.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Elephant is not mentioned in the problem, so we assume its INEXISTENCE in the location (number in the location = 0).
- The number of Bear is 379 plus the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Tiger is 865 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon is 56 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Wolf is 387 plus the number of Raccoon.

- Therefore, the number of Bear is 379 + 865 + 387 = 1631.
- The number of Horse is 1631 + 0 = 1631.
- The number of Kangaroo is 1631.

**Answer: 1631**<eos>
Define Lion as g; so g = 729. Define Raccoon as p; v = g = 729; so p = 56 + v = 56 + 729 = 785. Define Wolf as J; i = p = 785; so J = 387 + i = 387 + 785 = 1172. Define Tiger as Y; I = J = 1172; so Y = 865 + I = 865 + 1172 = 2037. Define Bear as F; H = Y + p = 2037 + 785 = 2822; n = H + J = 2822 + 1172 = 3994; so F = 379 + n = 379 + 3994 = 4373. Define Elephant as N; P = F = 4373; so N = 653 + P = 653 + 4373 = 5026. Define Horse as W; k = N + F = 5026 + 4373 = 9399; so W = k + Y = 9399 + 2037 = 11436. Define Kangaroo as q; so q = W = 11436. Answer: 11436.
**arguments:**

- the number of kangaroo equals the number of horse.
- the number of horse equals the sum of the number of elephant, the number of bear, and the number of tiger.

**calculation:**

- the number of elephant is not mentioned in the problem, so we assume its inexistence in the location (number in the location = 0).
- the number of bear is 379 plus the sum of the number of tiger, the number of raccoon, and the number of wolf.
- the number of tiger is 865 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of raccoon is 56 plus the number of lion.
- the number of wolf is 387 plus the number of raccoon.

- therefore, the number of bear is 379 + 865 + 387 = 1631.
- the number of horse is 1631 + 0 = 1631.
- the number of kangaroo is 1631.

- The number of Owl equals 123 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Sparrow equals 536.
- The number of Penguin equals 650 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Peacock, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Penguin, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow equals 971.
- The number of Eagle equals 310 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Peacock equals 327 plus the number of Hawk.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle as:
Number of Eagle = 310 + (Number of Owl + Number of Sparrow)
- We can also calculate the number of Peacock as:
Number of Peacock = 327 + Number of Hawk
- The number of Blue Jay is given by:
Number of Blue Jay = Number of Peacock + Number of Sparrow + Number of Hawk
- Substituting the expressions for Number of Eagle and Number of Peacock into the equation for Number of Blue Jay, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = (327 + Number of Hawk) + 536 + (Number of Parrot + Number of Penguin + Number of Eagle)
- Simplifying this expression, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 863 + Number of Hawk + Number of Parrot + Number of Penguin
- We can calculate the number of Hawk as:
Number of Hawk = Number of Parrot + Number of Penguin + Number of Eagle
- Substituting this expression for Number of Hawk into the equation for Number of Blue Jay, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 863 + (Number of Parrot + Number of Penguin + Number of Eagle) + Number of Parrot + Number of Penguin
- Simplifying further, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 2 * Number of Parrot + 2 * Number of Penguin + Number of Eagle + 863
- Substituting the given values, we get:
Number of Blue Jay = 2 * 570 + 2 * 650 + 310 + 863 = 3263

**Answer: 3263**<eos>
Define Sparrow as c; so c = 536. Define Penguin as w; G = c = 536; so w = 650 + G = 650 + 536 = 1186. Define Owl as C; t = w = 1186; so C = 123 + t = 123 + 1186 = 1309. Define Eagle as H; O = C + c = 1309 + 536 = 1845; so H = 310 + O = 310 + 1845 = 2155. Define Parrot as J; A = H = 2155; so J = 570 + A = 570 + 2155 = 2725. Define Hawk as y; R = J + w = 2725 + 1186 = 3911; so y = R + H = 3911 + 2155 = 6066. Define Peacock as Z; d = y = 6066; so Z = 327 + d = 327 + 6066 = 6393. Define Blue Jay as b; o = Z + c = 6393 + 536 = 6929; so b = o + y = 6929 + 6066 = 12995. Answer: 12995.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals 518 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 797 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Wolf equals 728.
- The number of Deer equals 957 plus the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals 709 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Raccoon equals 43 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Wolf, the number of Bear, and the number of Tiger.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf is 728.
- The number of Tiger is 518 + 728 = 1246.
- The number of Fox is 797 + 1246 = 2043.
- The number of Bear is equal to the number of Fox, which is 2043.
- The number of Lion is the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Wolf, the number of Bear, and the number of Tiger. Therefore, the number of Lion is 709 + 2043 + 728 + 1246 = 4764.
- The number of Deer is 957 + (number of Lion + number of Wolf). Therefore, the number of Deer is 957 + (4764 + 728) = 6219.
- The number of Raccoon is 43 + number of Deer. Therefore, the number of Raccoon is 43 + 6219 = 6262.

**Answer: 6262**<eos>
Define Wolf as c; so c = 728. Define Tiger as S; e = c = 728; so S = 518 + e = 518 + 728 = 1246. Define Fox as p; O = S = 1246; so p = 797 + O = 797 + 1246 = 2043. Define Bear as Z; so Z = p = 2043. Define Elephant as R; T = Z = 2043; so R = 709 + T = 709 + 2043 = 2752. Define Lion as A; k = R + c = 2752 + 728 = 3480; a = k + Z = 3480 + 2043 = 5523; so A = a + S = 5523 + 1246 = 6769. Define Deer as H; d = A + c = 6769 + 728 = 7497; so H = 957 + d = 957 + 7497 = 8454. Define Raccoon as C; K = H = 8454; so C = 43 + K = 43 + 8454 = 8497. Answer: 8497.
**arguments:**

- the number of tiger equals 518 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of bear equals the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 797 plus the number of tiger.
- the number of wolf equals 728.
- the number of deer equals 957 plus the sum of the number of lion and the number of wolf.
- the number of elephant equals 709 plus the number of bear.
- the number of raccoon equals 43 plus the number of deer.
- the number of lion equals the sum of the number of elephant, the number of wolf, the number of bear, and the number of tiger.

**calculation:**

- the number of wolf is 728.
- the number of tiger is 518 + 728 = 1246.
- the number of fox is 797 + 1246 = 2043.
- the number of bear is equal to the number of fox, which is 2043.
- the number of lion is the sum of the number of elephant, the number of wolf, the number of bear, and the number of tiger. therefore, the number of lion is 709 + 2043 + 728 + 1246 = 4764.
- the number of deer is 957 + (number of lion + number of wolf). therefore, the number of deer is 957 + (4764 + 728) = 6219.
- the number of raccoon is 43 + number of deer. therefore, the number of raccoon is 43 + 6219 = 6262.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Lion, the number of Tiger, and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals 282 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Elephant.
- The number of Tiger equals 781 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals 470 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Raccoon equals 338 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Elephant equals 939.
- The number of Horse equals 112 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Deer.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Horse and the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Deer = Lion + Tiger + Elephant = Lion + 781 + 939 = Lion + 1720.
- The number of Fox = 282 + Bear + Elephant = 282 + 470 + 939 = 1691.
- The number of Wolf = Deer = Lion + 1720.
- The number of Raccoon = 338 + Wolf = 338 + (Lion + 1720) = Lion + 2058.

**Answer: Answer: Lion + 2058**<eos>
Define Elephant as V; so V = 939. Define Bear as E; c = V = 939; so E = 470 + c = 470 + 939 = 1409. Define Fox as a; M = E + V = 1409 + 939 = 2348; so a = 282 + M = 282 + 2348 = 2630. Define Tiger as K; P = a = 2630; so K = 781 + P = 781 + 2630 = 3411. Define Horse as u; g = K = 3411; so u = 112 + g = 112 + 3411 = 3523. Define Lion as r; so r = u + a = 3523 + 2630 = 6153. Define Deer as n; h = r + K = 6153 + 3411 = 9564; so n = h + V = 9564 + 939 = 10503. Define Wolf as G; so G = n = 10503. Define Raccoon as d; U = G = 10503; so d = 338 + U = 338 + 10503 = 10841. Answer: 10841.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 841 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Penguin equals 719 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Parrot equals 856 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow equals 613.
- The number of Owl equals 179 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Hawk equals 757 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Crow.
- The number of Eagle equals 817 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 860 plus the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Hawk as:
Number of Hawk = 757 + (Number of Eagle + Number of Crow)
- We can also calculate the number of Penguin as:
Number of Penguin = 719 + Number of Hawk
- And the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = 841 + (Number of Blue Jay + Number of Hawk)
- Substituting the values of Number of Hawk and Number of Blue Jay from above, we get:
Number of Sparrow = 841 + (860 + 757) = 2458

**Answer: 2458**<eos>
Define Crow as G; so G = 613. Define Eagle as E; M = G = 613; so E = 817 + M = 817 + 613 = 1430. Define Hawk as S; W = E + G = 1430 + 613 = 2043; so S = 757 + W = 757 + 2043 = 2800. Define Penguin as n; N = S = 2800; so n = 719 + N = 719 + 2800 = 3519. Define Parrot as v; O = n + E = 3519 + 1430 = 4949; so v = 856 + O = 856 + 4949 = 5805. Define Owl as b; B = v = 5805; so b = 179 + B = 179 + 5805 = 5984. Define Blue Jay as Y; L = b = 5984; so Y = 860 + L = 860 + 5984 = 6844. Define Sparrow as u; a = Y + S = 6844 + 2800 = 9644; so u = 841 + a = 841 + 9644 = 10485. Answer: 10485.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 923 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 236 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Tiger.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Tiger.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 858 plus the number of Horse.
- The number of Horse equals 128 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Bear.

**Solving the equations step by step:**

1. From the equation "The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Tiger.", we have:
Number of Raccoon = Number of Lion + Number of Tiger

2. From the equation "The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Fox.", we have:
Number of Lion = Number of Deer + Number of Fox

3. From the equation "The number of Fox equals 858 plus the number of Horse.", we have:
Number of Fox = 858 + Number of Horse

4. From the equation "The number of Horse equals 128 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Bear.", we have:
Number of Horse = 128 + Number of Tiger + Number of Bear

5. Substitute the equations 2, 3, and 4 into equation 1, we get:
Number of Raccoon = (Number of Deer + Number of Fox) + Number of Tiger

6. Substitute the equation 3 into equation 5, we get:
Number of Raccoon = (Number of Deer + 858 + Number of Horse) + Number of Tiger

7. We know that the number of Bear equals 706, so the number of Tiger equals 897 - 706 = 191.

8. Substitute the value of Tiger into equation 7, we get:
Number of Raccoon = (Number of Deer + 858 + 128 + Number of Bear) + 191

9. We can now solve for the number of Elephant:
Number of Elephant = 923 + 236 - Number of Raccoon
Number of Elephant = 923 + 236 - (Number of Deer + 858 + 128 + Number of Bear + 191)
Number of Elephant = 1150 - (Number of Deer + Number of Bear + 858 + Number of Bear)
Number of Elephant = 1150 - (279 + 706 + 858 + 706)
**Answer: 1150 - 279 - 706 - 858 - 706 = 115**<eos>
Define Bear as v; so v = 706. Define Tiger as D; h = v = 706; so D = 897 + h = 897 + 706 = 1603. Define Horse as P; f = D + v = 1603 + 706 = 2309; so P = 128 + f = 128 + 2309 = 2437. Define Fox as Z; r = P = 2437; so Z = 858 + r = 858 + 2437 = 3295. Define Deer as K; z = Z = 3295; so K = 279 + z = 279 + 3295 = 3574. Define Lion as p; so p = K + Z = 3574 + 3295 = 6869. Define Raccoon as l; so l = p + D = 6869 + 1603 = 8472. Define Wolf as J; N = l = 8472; so J = 236 + N = 236 + 8472 = 8708. Define Elephant as E; U = J = 8708; so E = 923 + U = 923 + 8708 = 9631. Answer: 9631.
**arguments:**

- the number of elephant equals 923 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 236 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of lion and the number of tiger.

**calculation:**

- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of lion and the number of tiger.
- the number of lion equals the sum of the number of deer and the number of fox.
- the number of fox equals 858 plus the number of horse.
- the number of horse equals 128 plus the sum of the number of tiger and the number of bear.

**solving the equations step by step:**

1. from the equation "the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of lion and the number of tiger.", we have:
number of raccoon = number of lion + number of tiger

2. from the equation "the number of lion equals the sum of the number of deer and the number of fox.", we have:
number of lion = number of deer + number of fox

3. from the equation "the number of fox equals 858 plus the number of horse.", we have:
number of fox = 858 + number of horse

4. from the equation "the number of horse equals 128 plus the sum of the number of tiger and the number of bear.", we have:
number of horse = 128 + number of tiger + number of bear

5. substitute the equations 2, 3, and 4 into equation 1, we get:
number of raccoon = (number of deer + number of fox) + number of tiger

6. substitute the equation 3 into equation 5, we get:
number of raccoon = (number of deer + 858 + number of horse) + number of tiger

7. we know that the number of bear equals 706, so the number of tiger equals 897 - 706 = 191.

8. substitute the value of tiger into equation 7, we get:
number of raccoon = (number of deer + 858 + 128 + number of bear) + 191

9. we can now solve for the number of elephant:
number of elephant = 923 + 236 - number of raccoon
number of elephant = 923 + 236 - (number of deer + 858 + 128 + number of bear + 191)
number of elephant = 1150 - (number of deer + number of bear + 858 + number of bear)
number of elephant = 1150 - (279 + 706 + 858 + 706)
**answer: 1150 - 279 - 706 - 858 - 706 = 115**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 160 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Crow, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals 8 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals 796.
- The number of Sparrow equals 332 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 506 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Crow.
- The number of Penguin equals 16 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Parrot, and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Sparrow = 332 + 796 = 1128
- The number of Crow = 160 + 1128 = 1288
- The number of Eagle = Hawk + Crow + Blue Jay
- The number of Blue Jay = 506 + Parrot
- The number of Parrot = 8 + Crow
- The number of Penguin = 16 + Eagle + Parrot + Blue Jay
- Therefore, the number of Penguin = 16 + (Hawk + 1288 + 506 + 8 + 1128) = 16 + 2620 = 2636

**Answer: 2636**<eos>
Define Owl as Z; so Z = 796. Define Sparrow as E; e = Z = 796; so E = 332 + e = 332 + 796 = 1128. Define Crow as K; j = E = 1128; so K = 160 + j = 160 + 1128 = 1288. Define Parrot as N; M = K = 1288; so N = 8 + M = 8 + 1288 = 1296. Define Blue Jay as p; o = N = 1296; so p = 506 + o = 506 + 1296 = 1802. Define Hawk as x; so x = p + K = 1802 + 1288 = 3090. Define Eagle as J; r = x + K = 3090 + 1288 = 4378; so J = r + p = 4378 + 1802 = 6180. Define Penguin as w; O = J + N = 6180 + 1296 = 7476; h = O + p = 7476 + 1802 = 9278; so w = 16 + h = 16 + 9278 = 9294. Answer: 9294.
**arguments:**

- the number of crow equals 160 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of hawk, the number of crow, and the number of blue jay.
- the number of parrot equals 8 plus the number of crow.
- the number of owl equals 796.
- the number of sparrow equals 332 plus the number of owl.
- the number of blue jay equals 506 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of hawk equals the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of crow.
- the number of penguin equals 16 plus the sum of the number of eagle, the number of parrot, and the number of blue jay.

**calculation:**

- the number of sparrow = 332 + 796 = 1128
- the number of crow = 160 + 1128 = 1288
- the number of eagle = hawk + crow + blue jay
- the number of blue jay = 506 + parrot
- the number of parrot = 8 + crow
- the number of penguin = 16 + eagle + parrot + blue jay
- therefore, the number of penguin = 16 + (hawk + 1288 + 506 + 8 + 1128) = 16 + 2620 = 2636

- The number of Crow equals 484 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 433.
- The number of Peacock equals 486 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Penguin equals 991 plus the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculations:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Owl:
Number of Owl = Number of Sparrow + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Peacock + Number of Penguin
Number of Owl = (Number of Peacock + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Penguin) + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Peacock + Number of Penguin
Number of Owl = 2 * (Number of Peacock + Number of Penguin)
- We can also calculate the number of Parrot:
Number of Parrot = Number of Owl + Number of Owl
Number of Parrot = 2 * Number of Owl
- The number of Eagle is:
Number of Eagle = Number of Parrot + Number of Blue Jay
Number of Eagle = 2 * Number of Owl + Number of Blue Jay
- The number of Crow is:
Number of Crow = 484 + Number of Eagle
Number of Crow = 484 + 2 * Number of Owl + Number of Blue Jay

**Answer:**

**Answer: 484 + 2 * Number of Owl + Number of Blue Jay**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as T; so T = 433. Define Penguin as M; k = T = 433; so M = 991 + k = 991 + 433 = 1424. Define Peacock as Q; n = M = 1424; so Q = 486 + n = 486 + 1424 = 1910. Define Sparrow as p; b = Q + T = 1910 + 433 = 2343; so p = b + M = 2343 + 1424 = 3767. Define Owl as W; a = p + T = 3767 + 433 = 4200; y = a + Q = 4200 + 1910 = 6110; so W = y + M = 6110 + 1424 = 7534. Define Parrot as D; E = W = 7534; so D = 256 + E = 256 + 7534 = 7790. Define Eagle as P; so P = D + T = 7790 + 433 = 8223. Define Crow as A; N = P = 8223; so A = 484 + N = 484 + 8223 = 8707. Answer: 8707.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 256 plus the number of owl.
- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of parrot and the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of sparrow, the number of blue jay, the number of peacock, and the number of penguin.
- the number of sparrow equals the sum of the number of peacock, the number of blue jay, and the number of penguin.
- the number of hawk equals the number of blue jay.
- the number of crow equals 484 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of blue jay equals 433.
- the number of peacock equals 486 plus the number of penguin.
- the number of penguin equals 991 plus the number of blue jay.

**calculations:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of owl:
number of owl = number of sparrow + number of blue jay + number of peacock + number of penguin
number of owl = (number of peacock + number of blue jay + number of penguin) + number of blue jay + number of peacock + number of penguin
number of owl = 2 * (number of peacock + number of penguin)
- we can also calculate the number of parrot:
number of parrot = number of owl + number of owl
number of parrot = 2 * number of owl
- the number of eagle is:
number of eagle = number of parrot + number of blue jay
number of eagle = 2 * number of owl + number of blue jay
- the number of crow is:
number of crow = 484 + number of eagle
number of crow = 484 + 2 * number of owl + number of blue jay

**answer:**

**answer: 484 + 2 * number of owl + number of blue jay**<eos>

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question!

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 911 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 140 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Hawk equals 184 plus the number of Penguin.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Hawk equals 184 plus the number of Penguin = 184 + (716 + 291 + 440) = 184 + 1441 = 1625.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 140 plus the number of Hawk = 140 + 1625 = 1765.
- The number of Crow equals 911 plus the number of Blue Jay = 911 + 1765 = 2676.

**Answer: 2676**<eos>
Define Owl as D; so D = 440. Define Parrot as x; H = D = 440; so x = 736 + H = 736 + 440 = 1176. Define Eagle as L; so L = x = 1176. Define Sparrow as T; c = L + D = 1176 + 440 = 1616; i = c + x = 1616 + 1176 = 2792; so T = 291 + i = 291 + 2792 = 3083. Define Penguin as n; f = T = 3083; so n = 716 + f = 716 + 3083 = 3799. Define Hawk as y; K = n = 3799; so y = 184 + K = 184 + 3799 = 3983. Define Blue Jay as p; q = y = 3983; so p = 140 + q = 140 + 3983 = 4123. Define Crow as a; X = p = 4123; so a = 911 + X = 911 + 4123 = 5034. Answer: 5034.
**arguments:**

- the number of crow equals 911 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of blue jay equals 140 plus the number of hawk.
- the number of hawk equals 184 plus the number of penguin.

**calculation:**

- the number of hawk equals 184 plus the number of penguin = 184 + (716 + 291 + 440) = 184 + 1441 = 1625.
- the number of blue jay equals 140 plus the number of hawk = 140 + 1625 = 1765.
- the number of crow equals 911 plus the number of blue jay = 911 + 1765 = 2676.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Elephant equals 74 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 285 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 292 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Tiger.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon = 285 + 292 = 577
- The number of Elephant = 74 + 577 = 651

**Answer: 651**<eos>
Define Horse as f; so f = 600. Define Lion as a; w = f = 600; so a = 769 + w = 769 + 600 = 1369. Define Fox as O; j = a + f = 1369 + 600 = 1969; so O = 592 + j = 592 + 1969 = 2561. Define Tiger as H; C = O + f = 2561 + 600 = 3161; so H = C + a = 3161 + 1369 = 4530. Define Deer as P; so P = H + O = 4530 + 2561 = 7091. Define Wolf as p; so p = P + H = 7091 + 4530 = 11621. Define Bear as K; d = p = 11621; so K = 292 + d = 292 + 11621 = 11913. Define Raccoon as y; D = K = 11913; so y = 285 + D = 285 + 11913 = 12198. Define Elephant as N; q = y = 12198; so N = 74 + q = 74 + 12198 = 12272. Answer: 12272.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Fox equals 300 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Deer equals 189.
- The number of Raccoon equals 227 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Bear equals 888 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Tiger, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Tiger equals 25 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Deer, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 535 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Elephant equals 419 plus the number of Bear.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Tiger is 25 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Deer, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon is 227 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf is 535 plus the number of Deer.
- Therefore, the number of Tiger is 25 + 227 + 535 + Deer.
- The number of Bear is 888 plus the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Tiger, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Fox is 300 plus the number of Tiger.
- Therefore, the number of Bear is 888 + (300 + Tiger + 227 + Wolf + 535 + Deer).
- The number of Elephant is 419 plus the number of Bear.
- Therefore, the number of Elephant is 419 + (888 + (300 + Tiger + 227 + Wolf + 535 + Deer)).

**Answer: Answer: 419 + (888 + (300 + Tiger + 227 + Wolf + 535 + Deer)) = 419 + 1740 + Tiger + Deer**<eos>
Define Deer as m; so m = 189. Define Wolf as E; s = m = 189; so E = 535 + s = 535 + 189 = 724. Define Raccoon as c; L = E = 724; so c = 227 + L = 227 + 724 = 951. Define Tiger as G; A = c + m = 951 + 189 = 1140; B = A + E = 1140 + 724 = 1864; so G = 25 + B = 25 + 1864 = 1889. Define Fox as N; k = G = 1889; so N = 300 + k = 300 + 1889 = 2189. Define Bear as S; i = N + G = 2189 + 1889 = 4078; I = i + E = 4078 + 724 = 4802; so S = 888 + I = 888 + 4802 = 5690. Define Elephant as R; u = S = 5690; so R = 419 + u = 419 + 5690 = 6109. Answer: 6109.
**arguments:**

- the number of fox equals 300 plus the number of tiger.
- the number of deer equals 189.
- the number of raccoon equals 227 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of bear equals 888 plus the sum of the number of fox, the number of tiger, and the number of wolf.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Bear equals 257 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 689 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Fox.
- The number of Elephant equals 822 plus the number of Fox.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox equals 86 plus the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Wolf, and the number of Lion.
=> The number of Fox equals 86 + (Tiger + Wolf + Lion).
- The number of Lion equals 400 plus the number of Wolf.
- The number of Tiger equals 888 plus the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Wolf.
=> The number of Tiger equals 888 + (Lion + Wolf).

Substituting the above equations, we get:

The number of Bear equals 257 + 689 + (86 + (888 + (Lion + Wolf))).
Simplifying, we get:

The number of Bear equals 257 + 689 + 86 + 888 + Lion + Wolf.
Combining like terms, we get:

The number of Bear equals 1830 + Lion + Wolf.

**Answer: 1830 + Lion + Wolf**<eos>
Define Wolf as E; so E = 811. Define Lion as m; M = E = 811; so m = 400 + M = 400 + 811 = 1211. Define Tiger as p; H = m + E = 1211 + 811 = 2022; so p = 888 + H = 888 + 2022 = 2910. Define Fox as P; i = p + E = 2910 + 811 = 3721; u = i + m = 3721 + 1211 = 4932; so P = 86 + u = 86 + 4932 = 5018. Define Elephant as t; N = P = 5018; so t = 822 + N = 822 + 5018 = 5840. Define Deer as K; so K = t + P = 5840 + 5018 = 10858. Define Raccoon as o; T = K = 10858; so o = 689 + T = 689 + 10858 = 11547. Define Bear as h; k = o = 11547; so h = 257 + k = 257 + 11547 = 11804. Answer: 11804.
**arguments:**

- the number of bear equals 257 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of raccoon equals 689 plus the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of elephant and the number of fox.
- the number of elephant equals 822 plus the number of fox.

**calculation:**

- the number of fox equals 86 plus the sum of the number of tiger, the number of wolf, and the number of lion.
=> the number of fox equals 86 + (tiger + wolf + lion).
- the number of lion equals 400 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of tiger equals 888 plus the sum of the number of lion and the number of wolf.
=> the number of tiger equals 888 + (lion + wolf).

substituting the above equations, we get:

the number of bear equals 257 + 689 + (86 + (888 + (lion + wolf))).
simplifying, we get:

the number of bear equals 257 + 689 + 86 + 888 + lion + wolf.
combining like terms, we get:

the number of bear equals 1830 + lion + wolf.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Penguin equals the number of Hawk.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Parrot, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk equals 721 plus the number of Peacock.
- The number of Owl equals 836 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot equals 644.
- The number of Eagle equals 781 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Sparrow equals the number of Penguin.
- The number of Peacock equals 888 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 553 plus the number of Crow.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Sparrow is equal to the number of Penguin, which is not explicitly given in the text. Therefore, we assume the number of Sparrow is equal to the number of Penguin, which is 0.
- The number of Crow is equal to the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Parrot, and the number of Sparrow. Therefore, the number of Crow is 0 + 644 + 0 = 644.
- The number of Blue Jay is equal to 553 plus the number of Crow. Therefore, the number of Blue Jay is 553 + 644 = 1197.

**Answer: 1197**<eos>
Define Parrot as b; so b = 644. Define Eagle as F; d = b = 644; so F = 781 + d = 781 + 644 = 1425. Define Peacock as E; J = F + b = 1425 + 644 = 2069; so E = 888 + J = 888 + 2069 = 2957. Define Hawk as l; u = E = 2957; so l = 721 + u = 721 + 2957 = 3678. Define Penguin as P; so P = l = 3678. Define Sparrow as S; so S = P = 3678. Define Owl as U; e = S = 3678; so U = 836 + e = 836 + 3678 = 4514. Define Crow as Z; A = U + b = 4514 + 644 = 5158; so Z = A + S = 5158 + 3678 = 8836. Define Blue Jay as L; K = Z = 8836; so L = 553 + K = 553 + 8836 = 9389. Answer: 9389.
**arguments:**

- the number of penguin equals the number of hawk.
- the number of crow equals the sum of the number of owl, the number of parrot, and the number of sparrow.
- the number of hawk equals 721 plus the number of peacock.
- the number of owl equals 836 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of parrot equals 644.
- the number of eagle equals 781 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of sparrow equals the number of penguin.
- the number of peacock equals 888 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of parrot.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Falcon.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 682 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals the number of Parrot.
- The number of Falcon equals 637 plus the number of Peacock.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Falcon is 637 + the number of Peacock = 637 + 617 = 1254.
- The number of Blue Jay is 682 + the number of Crow = 682 + (the number of Parrot) = 682 + 574 = 1256.
- The number of Owl is the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Falcon = 1256 + 1254 = 2510.

**Answer: 2510**<eos>
Define Peacock as m; so m = 279. Define Falcon as k; p = m = 279; so k = 637 + p = 637 + 279 = 916. Define Sparrow as t; r = k = 916; so t = 574 + r = 574 + 916 = 1490. Define Penguin as s; l = t = 1490; so s = 617 + l = 617 + 1490 = 2107. Define Eagle as U; h = s + t = 2107 + 1490 = 3597; so U = h + k = 3597 + 916 = 4513. Define Parrot as d; i = U + s = 4513 + 2107 = 6620; so d = i + t = 6620 + 1490 = 8110. Define Crow as e; so e = d = 8110. Define Blue Jay as y; F = e = 8110; so y = 682 + F = 682 + 8110 = 8792. Define Owl as V; so V = y + k = 8792 + 916 = 9708. Answer: 9708.
**arguments:**

- the number of owl equals the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of falcon.
- the number of blue jay equals 682 plus the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals the number of parrot.
- the number of falcon equals 637 plus the number of peacock.

**calculation:**

- the number of falcon is 637 + the number of peacock = 637 + 617 = 1254.
- the number of blue jay is 682 + the number of crow = 682 + (the number of parrot) = 682 + 574 = 1256.
- the number of owl is the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of falcon = 1256 + 1254 = 2510.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Peacock equals 725 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Parrot equals 738 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 915 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Hawk equals 329 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Peacock, the number of Owl, and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Penguin.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 127.
- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Penguin.
- The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Peacock and the number of Blue Jay.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay is 127.
- The number of Peacock is 725 + 127 = 852.
- The number of Parrot is 738 + Crow.
- The number of Crow is the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Penguin.
- The number of Hawk is 329 + Owl.
- The number of Owl is the number of Penguin.
- The number of Sparrow is 915 + Parrot.

Substituting the values of Blue Jay, Peacock, and Owl into the equations for Parrot, Crow, and Sparrow, we get:

- The number of Parrot is 738 + (852 - 127) = 1463.
- The number of Crow is the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Penguin.
- The number of Sparrow is 915 + 1463 = 2378.

**Answer: 2378**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as i; so i = 127. Define Peacock as F; h = i = 127; so F = 725 + h = 725 + 127 = 852. Define Penguin as W; so W = F + i = 852 + 127 = 979. Define Owl as D; so D = W = 979. Define Hawk as I; G = D = 979; so I = 329 + G = 329 + 979 = 1308. Define Eagle as a; N = I + F = 1308 + 852 = 2160; s = N + D = 2160 + 979 = 3139; so a = s + i = 3139 + 127 = 3266. Define Crow as p; so p = a + W = 3266 + 979 = 4245. Define Parrot as g; U = p = 4245; so g = 738 + U = 738 + 4245 = 4983. Define Sparrow as k; c = g = 4983; so k = 915 + c = 915 + 4983 = 5898. Answer: 5898.

- The number of Bear = 624 + Fox
- The number of Wolf = 170 + Elephant

**Answer:**

**Answer: 381 + (Wolf + 412 + Bear + Fox + Lion)**<eos>
Define Fox as A; so A = 311. Define Bear as v; l = A = 311; so v = 624 + l = 624 + 311 = 935. Define Raccoon as a; J = v + A = 935 + 311 = 1246; so a = 412 + J = 412 + 1246 = 1658. Define Lion as t; k = a + v = 1658 + 935 = 2593; so t = k + A = 2593 + 311 = 2904. Define Elephant as I; w = t = 2904; so I = 596 + w = 596 + 2904 = 3500. Define Wolf as e; s = I = 3500; so e = 170 + s = 170 + 3500 = 3670. Define Tiger as O; y = e + a = 3670 + 1658 = 5328; so O = y + I = 5328 + 3500 = 8828. Define Deer as F; j = O = 8828; so F = 381 + j = 381 + 8828 = 9209. Answer: 9209.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Peacock, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Peacock equals the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Crow equals 299 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 884.
- The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk equals 540 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 575 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 282 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Owl equals 435 plus the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Crow as:
Crow = 299 + Sparrow = 299 + 884 = 1183
- From the equation of Peacock, we can calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Peacock = Crow + Sparrow
Therefore, Sparrow = Peacock - Crow = (unknown) - 1183
- From the equation of Hawk, we can calculate the number of Owl as:
Hawk = 540 + Owl
Therefore, Owl = Hawk - 540 = (unknown) - 540
- We cannot calculate the number of Hawk directly from the given information.

**Answer:**

Answer: Cannot be determined from the given information.<eos>
Define Sparrow as R; so R = 884. Define Crow as p; k = R = 884; so p = 299 + k = 299 + 884 = 1183. Define Peacock as u; so u = p + R = 1183 + 884 = 2067. Define Eagle as a; f = u + R = 2067 + 884 = 2951; so a = f + p = 2951 + 1183 = 4134. Define Blue Jay as Q; z = a = 4134; so Q = 575 + z = 575 + 4134 = 4709. Define Penguin as o; so o = Q + R = 4709 + 884 = 5593. Define Parrot as c; X = o = 5593; so c = 282 + X = 282 + 5593 = 5875. Define Owl as w; E = c = 5875; so w = 435 + E = 435 + 5875 = 6310. Define Hawk as n; H = w = 6310; so n = 540 + H = 540 + 6310 = 6850. Answer: 6850.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of peacock, the number of sparrow, and the number of crow.
- the number of peacock equals the sum of the number of crow and the number of sparrow.
- the number of crow equals 299 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of sparrow equals 884.
- the number of penguin equals the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of sparrow.

- the number of blue jay equals 575 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of parrot equals 282 plus the number of penguin.
- the number of owl equals 435 plus the number of parrot.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of crow as:
crow = 299 + sparrow = 299 + 884 = 1183
- from the equation of peacock, we can calculate the number of sparrow as:
peacock = crow + sparrow
therefore, sparrow = peacock - crow = (unknown) - 1183
- from the equation of hawk, we can calculate the number of owl as:
hawk = 540 + owl
therefore, owl = hawk - 540 = (unknown) - 540
- we cannot calculate the number of hawk directly from the given information.

- The number of Crow = 330 + Owl + Hawk = 330 + 1148 + 32 = 1510.

**Answer: 1510**<eos>
Define Peacock as X; so X = 32. Define Eagle as K; so K = X = 32. Define Parrot as T; N = K = 32; so T = 801 + N = 801 + 32 = 833. Define Hawk as h; so h = T + X = 833 + 32 = 865. Define Sparrow as u; C = h = 865; so u = 461 + C = 461 + 865 = 1326. Define Penguin as i; f = u = 1326; so i = 624 + f = 624 + 1326 = 1950. Define Blue Jay as n; P = i + T = 1950 + 833 = 2783; so n = 724 + P = 724 + 2783 = 3507. Define Owl as v; x = n = 3507; so v = 424 + x = 424 + 3507 = 3931. Define Crow as g; S = v + h = 3931 + 865 = 4796; so g = 330 + S = 330 + 4796 = 5126. Answer: 5126.

- The number of Penguin equals 53 plus the number of Peacock.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 502 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 556 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Peacock equals 829 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow equals 378 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Sparrow.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Parrot equals the number of Sparrow, so let's assume both are x.
- The number of Owl is 70 plus the number of Penguin, so the number of Owl is x + 70.
- The number of Sparrow is 248, so x = 248.
- The number of Penguin is 53 plus the number of Peacock, so the number of Peacock is (x + 70) - 53 = x + 17.
- The number of Blue Jay is 502 plus the number of Owl, so the number of Blue Jay is 502 + (x + 17) = 519 + x.
- Therefore, the number of Blue Jay is 519 + 248 = 767.

**Answer: 767**<eos>
Define Sparrow as O; so O = 248. Define Parrot as R; so R = O = 248. Define Eagle as q; m = R = 248; so q = 556 + m = 556 + 248 = 804. Define Hawk as o; so o = q = 804. Define Crow as Q; r = o + O = 804 + 248 = 1052; so Q = 378 + r = 378 + 1052 = 1430. Define Peacock as B; c = Q = 1430; so B = 829 + c = 829 + 1430 = 2259. Define Penguin as U; h = B = 2259; so U = 53 + h = 53 + 2259 = 2312. Define Owl as C; k = U = 2312; so C = 70 + k = 70 + 2312 = 2382. Define Blue Jay as G; S = C = 2382; so G = 502 + S = 502 + 2382 = 2884. Answer: 2884.

= 510 + 522 + 322
= 1354
**Answer: 1354**<eos>
Define Sparrow as i; so i = 322. Define Eagle as Y; j = i = 322; so Y = 629 + j = 629 + 322 = 951. Define Owl as J; Q = Y = 951; so J = 229 + Q = 229 + 951 = 1180. Define Hawk as r; y = J + i = 1180 + 322 = 1502; so r = y + Y = 1502 + 951 = 2453. Define Penguin as z; f = r + Y = 2453 + 951 = 3404; so z = 473 + f = 473 + 3404 = 3877. Define Parrot as q; T = z = 3877; so q = 522 + T = 522 + 3877 = 4399. Define Crow as x; b = q = 4399; so x = 510 + b = 510 + 4399 = 4909. Define Blue Jay as S; o = x + q = 4909 + 4399 = 9308; so S = o + i = 9308 + 322 = 9630. Answer: 9630.

- The number of Fox equals 196 + 922 = 1118.

**Answer: 1118**<eos>
Define Deer as w; so w = 958. Define Bear as N; K = w = 958; so N = 218 + K = 218 + 958 = 1176. Define Horse as v; so v = N + w = 1176 + 958 = 2134. Define Tiger as k; i = v = 2134; so k = 910 + i = 910 + 2134 = 3044. Define Elephant as M; D = k + w = 3044 + 958 = 4002; so M = 267 + D = 267 + 4002 = 4269. Define Wolf as V; G = M + w = 4269 + 958 = 5227; so V = G + k = 5227 + 3044 = 8271. Define Raccoon as W; so W = V + v = 8271 + 2134 = 10405. Define Lion as c; E = W = 10405; so c = 922 + E = 922 + 10405 = 11327. Define Fox as r; X = c = 11327; so r = 196 + X = 196 + 11327 = 11523. Answer: 11523.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Penguin equals 690 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Peacock.
- The number of Peacock equals 682 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 400 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Owl equals 957 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Parrot equals 609.
- The number of Eagle equals 963 plus the number of Peacock.
- The number of Sparrow equals the number of Hawk.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 869 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Penguin.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Eagle and Peacock:
  - Penguin = 690 + Eagle + Peacock
  - Peacock = 682 + Owl
  - Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
    - Penguin = 690 + (682 + Owl) + Peacock
    - Penguin = 1372 + Owl + Peacock
  - Therefore, Eagle = Penguin - 1372 - Peacock

- We can also calculate the number of Crow and Blue Jay:
  - Crow = 400 + Blue Jay
  - Blue Jay = 869 + Parrot
  - Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
    - Crow = 400 + (869 + Parrot)
    - Crow = 1269 + Parrot

- Since the number of Sparrow equals the number of Hawk, we have:
  - Sparrow = Hawk = Penguin

- Finally, we can calculate the number of Sparrow:
  - Penguin = 690 + Eagle + Peacock
  - Sparrow = Penguin = 690 + Eagle + Peacock

**Answer: 690 + Eagle + Peacock**<eos>
Define Parrot as b; so b = 609. Define Blue Jay as t; e = b = 609; so t = 869 + e = 869 + 609 = 1478. Define Crow as X; d = t = 1478; so X = 400 + d = 400 + 1478 = 1878. Define Owl as Y; n = X = 1878; so Y = 957 + n = 957 + 1878 = 2835. Define Peacock as C; Z = Y = 2835; so C = 682 + Z = 682 + 2835 = 3517. Define Eagle as c; F = C = 3517; so c = 963 + F = 963 + 3517 = 4480. Define Penguin as z; p = c + C = 4480 + 3517 = 7997; so z = 690 + p = 690 + 7997 = 8687. Define Hawk as K; so K = z = 8687. Define Sparrow as i; so i = K = 8687. Answer: 8687.
**arguments:**

- the number of penguin equals 690 plus the sum of the number of eagle and the number of peacock.
- the number of peacock equals 682 plus the number of owl.
- the number of crow equals 400 plus the number of blue jay.
- the number of owl equals 957 plus the number of crow.
- the number of parrot equals 609.
- the number of eagle equals 963 plus the number of peacock.
- the number of sparrow equals the number of hawk.
- the number of blue jay equals 869 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of hawk equals the number of penguin.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of eagle and peacock:
  - penguin = 690 + eagle + peacock
  - peacock = 682 + owl
  - substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
    - penguin = 690 + (682 + owl) + peacock
    - penguin = 1372 + owl + peacock
  - therefore, eagle = penguin - 1372 - peacock

- we can also calculate the number of crow and blue jay:
  - crow = 400 + blue jay
  - blue jay = 869 + parrot
  - substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
    - crow = 400 + (869 + parrot)
    - crow = 1269 + parrot

- since the number of sparrow equals the number of hawk, we have:
  - sparrow = hawk = penguin

- finally, we can calculate the number of sparrow:
  - penguin = 690 + eagle + peacock
  - sparrow = penguin = 690 + eagle + peacock

**answer: 690 + eagle + peacock**<eos>

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals 539 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Fox, and the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 26 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Fox equals 700 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Lion.
- The number of Wolf equals 599 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Elephant equals 925 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Bear equals 668 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Lion equals 544.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Fox equals 700 + Elephant + Lion = 700 + 925 + 544 = 2169.
- The number of Raccoon equals 26 + Bear = 26 + 668 = 694.
- The number of Deer equals Wolf + Fox + Raccoon = 599 + 2169 + 694 = 3562.

**Answer: 3562**<eos>
Define Lion as t; so t = 544. Define Elephant as x; V = t = 544; so x = 925 + V = 925 + 544 = 1469. Define Fox as I; Y = x + t = 1469 + 544 = 2013; so I = 700 + Y = 700 + 2013 = 2713. Define Tiger as r; i = I = 2713; so r = 539 + i = 539 + 2713 = 3252. Define Bear as b; M = r = 3252; so b = 668 + M = 668 + 3252 = 3920. Define Raccoon as k; E = b = 3920; so k = 26 + E = 26 + 3920 = 3946. Define Wolf as z; U = k = 3946; so z = 599 + U = 599 + 3946 = 4545. Define Deer as H; T = z + I = 4545 + 2713 = 7258; so H = T + k = 7258 + 3946 = 11204. Answer: 11204.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Crow equals 911 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Parrot equals 884 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Penguin.
- The number of Hawk equals 781 plus the number of Peacock.
- The number of Sparrow equals 472 plus the number of Peacock.
- The number of Eagle equals 434 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Peacock equals 233 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Penguin equals 138 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 272 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 920.

**Calculation:**

- From the equation for Crow, we have:
Number of Crow = 911 + Number of Parrot + Number of Eagle
- From the equation for Parrot, we have:
Number of Parrot = 884 + Number of Hawk + Number of Penguin
- From the equation for Hawk, we have:
Number of Hawk = 781 + Number of Peacock
- From the equation for Peacock, we have:
Number of Peacock = 233 + Number of Owl
- From the equation for Penguin, we have:
Number of Penguin = 138 + Number of Eagle
- From the equation for Eagle, we have:
Number of Eagle = 434 + Number of Blue Jay
- From the equation for Blue Jay, we have:
Number of Blue Jay = 920

**Answer:**

Number of Crow = 911 + 884 + 434 = **2231**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as f; so f = 920. Define Eagle as G; v = f = 920; so G = 434 + v = 434 + 920 = 1354. Define Penguin as k; D = G = 1354; so k = 138 + D = 138 + 1354 = 1492. Define Owl as I; q = k = 1492; so I = 272 + q = 272 + 1492 = 1764. Define Peacock as u; X = I = 1764; so u = 233 + X = 233 + 1764 = 1997. Define Hawk as j; o = u = 1997; so j = 781 + o = 781 + 1997 = 2778. Define Parrot as E; b = j + k = 2778 + 1492 = 4270; so E = 884 + b = 884 + 4270 = 5154. Define Crow as T; Q = E + G = 5154 + 1354 = 6508; so T = 911 + Q = 911 + 6508 = 7419. Answer: 7419.

- The number of Raccoon equals 540.
- The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Bear.
- The number of Tiger equals 899 plus the number of Elephant.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Wolf equals 5 + (Bear + Raccoon + Fox) = 5 + (277 + 540 + 824) = 5 + 1645 = 1650.
- The number of Lion equals Deer + Bear = 910 + 277 = 1187.
- The number of Tiger equals 899 + Elephant = 899 + (575 + Lion) = 899 + (575 + 1187) = 899 + 1762 = 2661.

**Answer: 2661**<eos>
Define Raccoon as t; so t = 540. Define Fox as n; M = t = 540; so n = 824 + M = 824 + 540 = 1364. Define Bear as w; s = n = 1364; so w = 277 + s = 277 + 1364 = 1641. Define Wolf as V; T = w + t = 1641 + 540 = 2181; x = T + n = 2181 + 1364 = 3545; so V = 5 + x = 5 + 3545 = 3550. Define Deer as G; S = V = 3550; so G = 910 + S = 910 + 3550 = 4460. Define Lion as W; so W = G + w = 4460 + 1641 = 6101. Define Elephant as m; X = W = 6101; so m = 575 + X = 575 + 6101 = 6676. Define Tiger as C; Q = m = 6676; so C = 899 + Q = 899 + 6676 = 7575.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Raccoon equals 317 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Lion.
- The number of Bear equals 553 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Lion equals 114 plus the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Lion is 114 plus the number of Deer, so the number of Lion is 114 + 845 = 959.
- The number of Raccoon is 317 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Lion, so the number of Raccoon is 317 + (553 + 959) = 1869.

**Answer: 1869**<eos>
Define Deer as f; so f = 845. Define Lion as G; L = f = 845; so G = 114 + L = 114 + 845 = 959. Define Elephant as h; P = G + f = 959 + 845 = 1804; so h = 495 + P = 495 + 1804 = 2299. Define Wolf as g; X = h = 2299; so g = 445 + X = 445 + 2299 = 2744. Define Tiger as Y; M = g + f = 2744 + 845 = 3589; so Y = 402 + M = 402 + 3589 = 3991. Define Fox as K; o = Y = 3991; so K = 604 + o = 604 + 3991 = 4595. Define Bear as i; S = K = 4595; so i = 553 + S = 553 + 4595 = 5148. Define Raccoon as r; m = i + G = 5148 + 959 = 6107; so r = 317 + m = 317 + 6107 = 6424. Answer: 6424.
**arguments:**

- the number of raccoon equals 317 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of lion.
- the number of bear equals 553 plus the number of fox.
- the number of lion equals 114 plus the number of deer.

**calculation:**

- the number of lion is 114 plus the number of deer, so the number of lion is 114 + 845 = 959.
- the number of raccoon is 317 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of lion, so the number of raccoon is 317 + (553 + 959) = 1869.

- The number of Sparrow equals 840 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Hawk equals 767 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Peacock.
- The number of Crow equals 429.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we know that the number of Blue Jay equals the number of Sparrow. Therefore, let's assume both are x.
- The number of Peacock is x + x + Penguin. So, the number of Peacock is 2x + Penguin.
- The number of Eagle is 800 + Hawk. We know that Hawk equals Parrot, so the number of Eagle is 800 + Parrot.
- The number of Owl is Peacock. We know that Peacock is 2x + Penguin, so the number of Owl is 2x + Penguin.
- The number of Crow is 429.

**Answer:**

**Answer: 800 + Parrot**<eos>
Define Crow as a; so a = 429. Define Penguin as t; C = a = 429; so t = 779 + C = 779 + 429 = 1208. Define Sparrow as l; g = t = 1208; so l = 840 + g = 840 + 1208 = 2048. Define Blue Jay as o; so o = l = 2048. Define Peacock as V; S = o + l = 2048 + 2048 = 4096; so V = S + t = 4096 + 1208 = 5304. Define Owl as L; so L = V = 5304. Define Parrot as n; c = L = 5304; so n = 127 + c = 127 + 5304 = 5431. Define Hawk as Y; J = n = 5431; so Y = 767 + J = 767 + 5431 = 6198. Define Eagle as k; s = Y = 6198; so k = 800 + s = 800 + 6198 = 6998. Answer: 6998.

- The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Owl, and the number of Blue Jay = 672 + 812 + 668 = 2152.

**Answer: 1245**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as q; so q = 668. Define Owl as r; w = q = 668; so r = 812 + w = 812 + 668 = 1480. Define Sparrow as A; Z = r + q = 1480 + 668 = 2148; so A = 672 + Z = 672 + 2148 = 2820. Define Crow as f; F = A + r = 2820 + 1480 = 4300; so f = F + q = 4300 + 668 = 4968. Define Parrot as S; b = f = 4968; so S = 364 + b = 364 + 4968 = 5332. Define Eagle as K; G = S = 5332; so K = 894 + G = 894 + 5332 = 6226. Define Hawk as o; X = K = 6226; so o = 204 + X = 204 + 6226 = 6430. Define Penguin as N; C = o + K = 6430 + 6226 = 12656; so N = 147 + C = 147 + 12656 = 12803. Answer: 12803.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Hawk, and the number of Peacock.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 681 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Crow equals 52 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Sparrow equals 521 plus the number of Peacock.
- The number of Owl equals 649 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Penguin equals 704 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Peacock equals 771.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 681 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Hawk, and the number of Peacock.
- The number of Hawk equals the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow equals 521 plus the number of Peacock.

Substituting the above equations, we get:

The number of Blue Jay = 681 + (The sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Hawk)
= 681 + (The sum of the number of Owl, the number of Hawk, and the number of Peacock)
= 681 + (The number of Owl + The number of Hawk + The number of Peacock)
= 681 + (649 + The number of Hawk + 771)
= 681 + (649 + 52 + 771)
= 681 + 1342
= 1923

**Answer: 1923**<eos>
Define Peacock as b; so b = 771. Define Sparrow as J; s = b = 771; so J = 521 + s = 521 + 771 = 1292. Define Hawk as n; so n = J = 1292. Define Crow as w; T = n = 1292; so w = 52 + T = 52 + 1292 = 1344. Define Penguin as A; O = w = 1344; so A = 704 + O = 704 + 1344 = 2048. Define Owl as U; V = A = 2048; so U = 649 + V = 649 + 2048 = 2697. Define Eagle as E; L = U + n = 2697 + 1292 = 3989; so E = L + b = 3989 + 771 = 4760. Define Parrot as C; so C = E + n = 4760 + 1292 = 6052. Define Blue Jay as u; M = C = 6052; so u = 681 + M = 681 + 6052 = 6733. Answer: 6733.
**arguments:**

- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of owl, the number of hawk, and the number of peacock.
- the number of hawk equals the number of sparrow.
- the number of blue jay equals 681 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of crow equals 52 plus the number of hawk.

the number of blue jay = 681 + (the sum of the number of eagle and the number of hawk)
= 681 + (the sum of the number of owl, the number of hawk, and the number of peacock)
= 681 + (the number of owl + the number of hawk + the number of peacock)
= 681 + (649 + the number of hawk + 771)
= 681 + (649 + 52 + 771)
= 681 + 1342
= 1923

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Sparrow, the number of Hawk, and the number of Crow.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 818.
- The number of Hawk equals 6 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Owl equals 320 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Sparrow equals 927 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Penguin equals 141 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Hawk, and the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Hawk = 6 + 818 = 824.
- The number of Owl = 320 + 824 = 1144.
- The number of Sparrow = 927 + 1144 = 2071.
- The number of Blue Jay = 2071 + 824 + 1144 = 3039.
- The number of Eagle = 141 + 3039 = 3180.

**Answer: 3180**<eos>
Define Crow as V; so V = 818. Define Hawk as f; L = V = 818; so f = 6 + L = 6 + 818 = 824. Define Owl as F; J = f = 824; so F = 320 + J = 320 + 824 = 1144. Define Sparrow as M; y = F = 1144; so M = 927 + y = 927 + 1144 = 2071. Define Blue Jay as a; C = M + f = 2071 + 824 = 2895; so a = C + F = 2895 + 1144 = 4039. Define Parrot as j; m = a + M = 4039 + 2071 = 6110; Z = m + f = 6110 + 824 = 6934; so j = Z + V = 6934 + 818 = 7752. Define Penguin as q; X = j = 7752; so q = 141 + X = 141 + 7752 = 7893. Define Eagle as Q; so Q = q + F = 7893 + 1144 = 9037. Answer: 9037.

**Answer:**

**Answer: 36 + (501 + 565 + 373) = 1435**<eos>
Define Eagle as e; so e = 934. Define Hawk as b; E = e = 934; so b = 63 + E = 63 + 934 = 997. Define Penguin as Q; x = b = 997; so Q = 631 + x = 631 + 997 = 1628. Define Sparrow as m; so m = Q + b = 1628 + 997 = 2625. Define Crow as y; so y = m = 2625. Define Owl as v; r = y + b = 2625 + 997 = 3622; so v = 373 + r = 373 + 3622 = 3995. Define Peacock as U; k = v = 3995; so U = 565 + k = 565 + 3995 = 4560. Define Blue Jay as T; X = U + Q = 4560 + 1628 = 6188; so T = 501 + X = 501 + 6188 = 6689. Define Parrot as t; C = T = 6689; so t = 36 + C = 36 + 6689 = 6725. Answer: 6725.

- Therefore, the number of Fox is the sum of 897 + (444 + Raccoon) + Raccoon + 892.

**Answer:**

**Answer: 2233**<eos>
Define Tiger as x; so x = 892. Define Deer as i; Q = x = 892; so i = 373 + Q = 373 + 892 = 1265. Define Elephant as e; o = i = 1265; so e = 376 + o = 376 + 1265 = 1641. Define Raccoon as I; so I = e = 1641. Define Wolf as c; G = I + e = 1641 + 1641 = 3282; r = G + i = 3282 + 1265 = 4547; so c = r + x = 4547 + 892 = 5439. Define Bear as Y; L = c = 5439; so Y = 444 + L = 444 + 5439 = 5883. Define Lion as U; E = Y = 5883; so U = 897 + E = 897 + 5883 = 6780. Define Fox as H; s = U + e = 6780 + 1641 = 8421; so H = s + x = 8421 + 892 = 9313. Answer: 9313.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Deer equals the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Raccoon, the number of Lion, and the number of Bear.
- The number of Elephant equals 912 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Wolf equals the number of Fox.
- The number of Tiger equals 256 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Fox equals 447 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Lion equals 357 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Raccoon equals 59 plus the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Bear.
- The number of Bear equals 768.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Deer = Tiger + Raccoon + Lion + Bear = T + R + L + B
- The number of Elephant = 912 + Raccoon = 912 + R
- The number of Wolf = Fox = F
- The number of Tiger = 256 + Elephant = 256 + (912 + R) = 1168 + R
- The number of Fox = 447 + Deer = 447 + (T + R + L + B) = 447 + T + R + L + B
- The number of Lion = 357 + Bear = 357 + B
- The number of Raccoon = 59 + Lion + Bear = 59 + (357 + B) + B = 416 + 2B

**Answer:**

The number of Wolf is F = 447 + T + R + L + B.<eos>
Define Bear as s; so s = 768. Define Lion as Y; n = s = 768; so Y = 357 + n = 357 + 768 = 1125. Define Raccoon as q; A = Y + s = 1125 + 768 = 1893; so q = 59 + A = 59 + 1893 = 1952. Define Elephant as p; G = q = 1952; so p = 912 + G = 912 + 1952 = 2864. Define Tiger as e; M = p = 2864; so e = 256 + M = 256 + 2864 = 3120. Define Deer as j; g = e + q = 3120 + 1952 = 5072; O = g + Y = 5072 + 1125 = 6197; so j = O + s = 6197 + 768 = 6965. Define Fox as N; R = j = 6965; so N = 447 + R = 447 + 6965 = 7412. Define Wolf as z; so z = N = 7412. Answer: 7412.
**arguments:**

- the number of deer equals the sum of the number of tiger, the number of raccoon, the number of lion, and the number of bear.
- the number of elephant equals 912 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of wolf equals the number of fox.
- the number of tiger equals 256 plus the number of elephant.
- the number of fox equals 447 plus the number of deer.
- the number of lion equals 357 plus the number of bear.
- the number of raccoon equals 59 plus the sum of the number of lion and the number of bear.
- the number of bear equals 768.

**calculation:**

- the number of deer = tiger + raccoon + lion + bear = t + r + l + b
- the number of elephant = 912 + raccoon = 912 + r
- the number of wolf = fox = f
- the number of tiger = 256 + elephant = 256 + (912 + r) = 1168 + r
- the number of fox = 447 + deer = 447 + (t + r + l + b) = 447 + t + r + l + b
- the number of lion = 357 + bear = 357 + b
- the number of raccoon = 59 + lion + bear = 59 + (357 + b) + b = 416 + 2b

- The number of Deer equals 609 plus the number of Bear.
- The number of Lion equals 515 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox.
- The number of Elephant equals 468 plus the number of Tiger.
- The number of Tiger equals the sum of the number of Lion, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Raccoon equals 936 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Wolf.
- The number of Wolf equals 397 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Bear equals 350 plus the number of Fox.
- The number of Fox equals 1.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear is 350 plus the number of Fox, which is 1. Therefore, the number of Bear is 351.
- The number of Deer is 609 plus the number of Bear, which is 351. Therefore, the number of Deer is 960.
- The number of Lion is 515 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Fox, which is 1. Therefore, the number of Lion is 516.
- The number of Tiger is the sum of the number of Lion, the number of Fox, and the number of Wolf. Therefore, the number of Tiger is 516 + 1 + 397 = 914.
- The number of Elephant is 468 plus the number of Tiger, which is 914. Therefore, the number of Elephant is 1382.
- The number of Raccoon is 936 plus the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Wolf, which is 1382 + 397 = 1779.

**Answer: 1779**<eos>
Define Fox as p; so p = 1. Define Bear as G; e = p = 1; so G = 350 + e = 350 + 1 = 351. Define Deer as F; g = G = 351; so F = 609 + g = 609 + 351 = 960. Define Wolf as Z; u = F = 960; so Z = 397 + u = 397 + 960 = 1357. Define Lion as M; x = Z + p = 1357 + 1 = 1358; so M = 515 + x = 515 + 1358 = 1873. Define Tiger as R; n = M + p = 1873 + 1 = 1874; so R = n + Z = 1874 + 1357 = 3231. Define Elephant as r; N = R = 3231; so r = 468 + N = 468 + 3231 = 3699. Define Raccoon as K; Y = r + Z = 3699 + 1357 = 5056; so K = 936 + Y = 936 + 5056 = 5992. Answer: 5992.

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question!

- The number of Wolf equals 478.
- The number of Tiger equals 478 plus the number of Elephant.
- The number of Raccoon equals the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Bear equals 492 + number of Lion = 492 + x.
- The number of Elephant equals Raccoon + Horse = 0 + 779 = 779.
- The number of Fox equals Tiger + Bear + Elephant + Raccoon = (478 + x) + 492 + 779 + 663 = 2322 + x.
- Therefore, the number of Fox is 2322 + x.

**Answer: 2322 + x**<eos>
Define Wolf as J; so J = 478. Define Horse as Z; G = J = 478; so Z = 779 + G = 779 + 478 = 1257. Define Lion as S; so S = Z = 1257. Define Bear as W; B = S = 1257; so W = 492 + B = 492 + 1257 = 1749. Define Deer as q; l = W = 1749; so q = 663 + l = 663 + 1749 = 2412. Define Raccoon as L; so L = q = 2412. Define Elephant as c; so c = L + Z = 2412 + 1257 = 3669. Define Tiger as C; k = c = 3669; so C = 478 + k = 478 + 3669 = 4147. Define Fox as Y; H = C + W = 4147 + 1749 = 5896; R = H + c = 5896 + 3669 = 9565; so Y = R + L = 9565 + 2412 = 11977.

- The number of Eagle = 315 + Owl = 315 + 577 + 865 + 1577 = 2734

**Answer: 2734**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as q; so q = 493. Define Penguin as i; C = q = 493; so i = 584 + C = 584 + 493 = 1077. Define Hawk as o; d = i = 1077; so o = 500 + d = 500 + 1077 = 1577. Define Peacock as G; x = o + q = 1577 + 493 = 2070; so G = x + i = 2070 + 1077 = 3147. Define Parrot as k; so k = G + o = 3147 + 1577 = 4724. Define Crow as L; so L = k = 4724. Define Sparrow as W; r = L = 4724; so W = 865 + r = 865 + 4724 = 5589. Define Owl as z; a = W + G = 5589 + 3147 = 8736; so z = 577 + a = 577 + 8736 = 9313. Define Eagle as Q; K = z = 9313; so Q = 315 + K = 315 + 9313 = 9628. Answer: 9628.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Sparrow equals 925 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Parrot.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 717 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Eagle equals 564 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow equals the number of Hawk.
- The number of Penguin equals 533 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 239 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Hawk equals 464 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Parrot, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot equals 268.

**Calculation:**

- From the given information, we can calculate the number of Sparrow as:
Number of Sparrow = 925 + Owl + Parrot
- We can also calculate the number of Blue Jay as:
Number of Blue Jay = 717 + Sparrow
- The number of Eagle is given as:
Number of Eagle = 564 + Crow
- The number of Crow is equal to the number of Hawk, so we can write:
Crow = Hawk
- The number of Hawk is given as:
Hawk = 464 + Blue Jay + Parrot + Sparrow
- Substituting the expressions for Sparrow, Blue Jay, and Crow into the equation for Eagle, we get:
Number of Eagle = 564 + (925 + Owl + Parrot) + (717 + Sparrow) + Hawk
- Simplifying this expression, we get:
Number of Eagle = 564 + 1642 + Owl + Parrot + Hawk
- We know that Parrot equals 268, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
Number of Eagle = 564 + 1642 + Owl + 268 + Hawk
- We also know that Crow equals Hawk, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
Number of Eagle = 564 + 1642 + Owl + 268 + Crow
- Finally, we can calculate the number of Eagle by substituting the value of Owl (239) and Crow (464) into the equation:
Number of Eagle = 564 + 1642 + 239 + 268 + 464
**Answer: 3153**<eos>
Define Parrot as E; so E = 268. Define Penguin as M; p = E = 268; so M = 533 + p = 533 + 268 = 801. Define Owl as T; B = M = 801; so T = 239 + B = 239 + 801 = 1040. Define Sparrow as m; o = T + E = 1040 + 268 = 1308; so m = 925 + o = 925 + 1308 = 2233. Define Blue Jay as X; x = m = 2233; so X = 717 + x = 717 + 2233 = 2950. Define Hawk as k; l = X + E = 2950 + 268 = 3218; K = l + m = 3218 + 2233 = 5451; so k = 464 + K = 464 + 5451 = 5915. Define Crow as t; so t = k = 5915. Define Eagle as U; q = t = 5915; so U = 564 + q = 564 + 5915 = 6479. Answer: 6479.
**arguments:**

- the number of sparrow equals 925 plus the sum of the number of owl and the number of parrot.
- the number of blue jay equals 717 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of eagle equals 564 plus the number of crow.
- the number of crow equals the number of hawk.
- the number of penguin equals 533 plus the number of parrot.
- the number of owl equals 239 plus the number of penguin.
- the number of hawk equals 464 plus the sum of the number of blue jay, the number of parrot, and the number of sparrow.
- the number of parrot equals 268.

**calculation:**

- from the given information, we can calculate the number of sparrow as:
number of sparrow = 925 + owl + parrot
- we can also calculate the number of blue jay as:
number of blue jay = 717 + sparrow
- the number of eagle is given as:
number of eagle = 564 + crow
- the number of crow is equal to the number of hawk, so we can write:
crow = hawk
- the number of hawk is given as:
hawk = 464 + blue jay + parrot + sparrow
- substituting the expressions for sparrow, blue jay, and crow into the equation for eagle, we get:
number of eagle = 564 + (925 + owl + parrot) + (717 + sparrow) + hawk
- simplifying this expression, we get:
number of eagle = 564 + 1642 + owl + parrot + hawk
- we know that parrot equals 268, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
number of eagle = 564 + 1642 + owl + 268 + hawk
- we also know that crow equals hawk, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
number of eagle = 564 + 1642 + owl + 268 + crow
- finally, we can calculate the number of eagle by substituting the value of owl (239) and crow (464) into the equation:
number of eagle = 564 + 1642 + 239 + 268 + 464

**Arguments:**

- The number of Tiger equals 569 plus the number of Deer.
- The number of Deer equals 433 plus the number of Raccoon.
- The number of Raccoon equals 204 plus the sum of the number of Bear and the number of Fox.
- The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Elephant, and the number of Wolf.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon = 204 + (Bear + Fox)
- The number of Bear = Fox + Elephant + Wolf
- The number of Tiger = 569 + Deer
- The number of Deer = 433 + Raccoon
- The number of Fox = 632 + (Wolf + Elephant)

**Substituting the above equations into each other:**

- The number of Raccoon = 204 + (Fox + Elephant + Wolf)
- The number of Bear = Fox + Elephant + Wolf
- The number of Tiger = 569 + (433 + Raccoon)
- The number of Fox = 632 + (Wolf + Elephant)

**Solving the equations:**

- The number of Raccoon = 637 + Wolf
- The number of Bear = 632 + Wolf + Elephant
- The number of Tiger = 1102 + Wolf
- The number of Fox = 632 + Elephant

**Answer:**

**Answer: 1102**<eos>
Define Elephant as l; so l = 709. Define Lion as U; i = l = 709; so U = 60 + i = 60 + 709 = 769. Define Wolf as r; v = U = 769; so r = 805 + v = 805 + 769 = 1574. Define Fox as W; b = r + l = 1574 + 709 = 2283; so W = 632 + b = 632 + 2283 = 2915. Define Bear as k; R = W + l = 2915 + 709 = 3624; so k = R + r = 3624 + 1574 = 5198. Define Raccoon as Y; G = k + W = 5198 + 2915 = 8113; so Y = 204 + G = 204 + 8113 = 8317. Define Deer as d; x = Y = 8317; so d = 433 + x = 433 + 8317 = 8750. Define Tiger as s; j = d = 8750; so s = 569 + j = 569 + 8750 = 9319. Answer: 9319.
**arguments:**

- the number of tiger equals 569 plus the number of deer.
- the number of deer equals 433 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of raccoon equals 204 plus the sum of the number of bear and the number of fox.

- The number of Penguin = 530 + 859 = 1389.
- The number of Eagle = 414 + (530 + 1086) = 1630.

**Answer: 1630**<eos>
Define Sparrow as U; so U = 791. Define Falcon as Y; K = U = 791; so Y = 295 + K = 295 + 791 = 1086. Define Blue Jay as A; g = Y = 1086; so A = 699 + g = 699 + 1086 = 1785. Define Peacock as J; n = A = 1785; so J = 681 + n = 681 + 1785 = 2466. Define Hawk as p; j = J = 2466; so p = 248 + j = 248 + 2466 = 2714. Define Parrot as W; a = p + J = 2714 + 2466 = 5180; so W = 859 + a = 859 + 5180 = 6039. Define Penguin as N; F = W = 6039; so N = 530 + F = 530 + 6039 = 6569. Define Eagle as l; D = N + U = 6569 + 791 = 7360; so l = 414 + D = 414 + 7360 = 7774. Answer: 7774.

- The number of Elephant equals 71 plus the number of Lion.
- The number of Raccoon equals 829 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Deer.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Raccoon is 829 plus the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Deer.
- The number of Tiger is 872 plus the number of Deer.
- Therefore, the number of Raccoon is 829 + (872 + 20) = 1711.
- The number of Wolf is 418 plus the number of Raccoon.
- Therefore, the number of Wolf is 418 + 1711 = 2129.
- The number of Fox is 243 plus the number of Elephant.
- Therefore, the number of Fox is 243 + 71 = 314.

**Answer: 314**<eos>
Define Deer as k; so k = 20. Define Tiger as g; x = k = 20; so g = 872 + x = 872 + 20 = 892. Define Raccoon as n; H = g + k = 892 + 20 = 912; so n = 829 + H = 829 + 912 = 1741. Define Wolf as A; q = n = 1741; so A = 418 + q = 418 + 1741 = 2159. Define Bear as J; so J = A + n = 2159 + 1741 = 3900. Define Lion as I; K = J + A = 3900 + 2159 = 6059; w = K + k = 6059 + 20 = 6079; so I = w + g = 6079 + 892 = 6971. Define Elephant as W; V = I = 6971; so W = 71 + V = 71 + 6971 = 7042. Define Fox as T; y = W = 7042; so T = 243 + y = 243 + 7042 = 7285. Answer: 7285.
**arguments:**

- the number of wolf equals 418 plus the number of raccoon.
- the number of tiger equals 872 plus the number of deer.
- the number of fox equals 243 plus the number of elephant.
- the number of bear equals the sum of the number of wolf and the number of raccoon.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Parrot equals 705 plus the sum of the number of Peacock and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Falcon equals 115 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Penguin equals the number of Falcon.
- The number of Crow equals 253 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Sparrow equals 112.
- The number of Peacock equals 596 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 805 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Hawk equals 316 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Eagle equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Owl equals the number of Penguin.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Parrot = 705 + (Peacock + Sparrow)
- The number of Falcon = 115 + Sparrow
- The number of Penguin = Falcon = 115 + Sparrow
- The number of Crow = 253 + Hawk
- The number of Sparrow = 112
- The number of Peacock = 596 + Eagle
- The number of Blue Jay = 805 + Crow
- The number of Hawk = 316 + Penguin
- The number of Eagle = Blue Jay + Hawk
- The number of Owl = Penguin

- Substituting the value of Sparrow and Penguin into the equations:
  - Parrot = 705 + (596 + Eagle + 112) = 1313 + Eagle
  - Falcon = 115 + 112 = 227
  - Eagle = 1313 + 227 = 1540

- Therefore, the number of Parrot is 1313 + 1540 = **2853**<eos>
Define Sparrow as Z; so Z = 112. Define Falcon as t; K = Z = 112; so t = 115 + K = 115 + 112 = 227. Define Penguin as W; so W = t = 227. Define Hawk as a; z = W = 227; so a = 316 + z = 316 + 227 = 543. Define Crow as c; d = a = 543; so c = 253 + d = 253 + 543 = 796. Define Blue Jay as e; U = c = 796; so e = 805 + U = 805 + 796 = 1601. Define Eagle as i; so i = e + a = 1601 + 543 = 2144. Define Peacock as P; b = i = 2144; so P = 596 + b = 596 + 2144 = 2740. Define Parrot as R; A = P + Z = 2740 + 112 = 2852; so R = 705 + A = 705 + 2852 = 3557. Answer: 3557.
**arguments:**

- the number of parrot equals 705 plus the sum of the number of peacock and the number of sparrow.
- the number of falcon equals 115 plus the number of sparrow.
- the number of penguin equals the number of falcon.
- the number of crow equals 253 plus the number of hawk.
- the number of sparrow equals 112.
- the number of peacock equals 596 plus the number of eagle.
- the number of blue jay equals 805 plus the number of crow.
- the number of hawk equals 316 plus the number of penguin.
- the number of eagle equals the sum of the number of blue jay and the number of hawk.
- the number of owl equals the number of penguin.

**calculation:**

- the number of parrot = 705 + (peacock + sparrow)
- the number of falcon = 115 + sparrow
- the number of penguin = falcon = 115 + sparrow
- the number of crow = 253 + hawk
- the number of sparrow = 112
- the number of peacock = 596 + eagle
- the number of blue jay = 805 + crow
- the number of hawk = 316 + penguin
- the number of eagle = blue jay + hawk
- the number of owl = penguin

- substituting the value of sparrow and penguin into the equations:
  - parrot = 705 + (596 + eagle + 112) = 1313 + eagle
  - falcon = 115 + 112 = 227
  - eagle = 1313 + 227 = 1540

- therefore, the number of parrot is 1313 + 1540 = **2853**<eos>

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question!

- The number of Penguin equals 304 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 723 plus the number of Parrot.
- The number of Owl equals 859 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Crow equals 357 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Hawk equals 943.
- The number of Parrot equals 161 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Hawk.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Crow equals 357 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Owl equals 859 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Penguin equals 304 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 723 plus the number of Parrot.

- The number of Sparrow equals 461 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Hawk.
- The number of Eagle equals 866 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Hawk equals 943.

Substituting the values of the other variables into the equations, we get:

- The number of Penguin = 304 + (723 + 161 + 943) = 2409
- The number of Sparrow = 461 + (866 + 943) = 1870
- The number of Owl = 859 + 2409 = 3268
- The number of Crow = 357 + 3268 = 3625

**Answer: 3625**<eos>
Define Hawk as Q; so Q = 943. Define Eagle as c; X = Q = 943; so c = 866 + X = 866 + 943 = 1809. Define Sparrow as a; U = c + Q = 1809 + 943 = 2752; so a = 461 + U = 461 + 2752 = 3213. Define Parrot as n; r = a + Q = 3213 + 943 = 4156; so n = 161 + r = 161 + 4156 = 4317. Define Blue Jay as s; H = n = 4317; so s = 723 + H = 723 + 4317 = 5040. Define Penguin as S; T = s + a = 5040 + 3213 = 8253; so S = 304 + T = 304 + 8253 = 8557. Define Owl as J; k = S = 8557; so J = 859 + k = 859 + 8557 = 9416. Define Crow as x; Z = J = 9416; so x = 357 + Z = 357 + 9416 = 9773. Answer: 9773.

- The number of Parrot equals 352 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Eagle equals 742.
- The number of Penguin equals 452 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Crow equals 843 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Parrot.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Crow = 843 + (number of Owl + number of Parrot)
- The number of Crow = 843 + (number of Owl + 352)
- The number of Crow = 843 + number of Owl + 352
- The number of Crow = 1195 + number of Owl

- The number of Penguin = 452 + (number of Hawk + number of Eagle)
- The number of Penguin = 452 + (681 + 742)
- The number of Penguin = 452 + 1423
- The number of Penguin = 1875

**Answer: 1875**<eos>
Define Eagle as e; so e = 742. Define Blue Jay as B; u = e = 742; so B = 74 + u = 74 + 742 = 816. Define Parrot as o; T = B = 816; so o = 352 + T = 352 + 816 = 1168. Define Sparrow as J; n = o = 1168; so J = 430 + n = 430 + 1168 = 1598. Define Owl as L; P = J + o = 1598 + 1168 = 2766; so L = P + e = 2766 + 742 = 3508. Define Crow as w; N = L + o = 3508 + 1168 = 4676; so w = 843 + N = 843 + 4676 = 5519. Define Hawk as F; f = w = 5519; so F = 681 + f = 681 + 5519 = 6200. Define Penguin as l; y = F + e = 6200 + 742 = 6942; so l = 452 + y = 452 + 6942 = 7394. Answer: 7394.

**Answer: 4192**<eos>
Define Tiger as I; so I = 646. Define Wolf as j; z = I = 646; so j = 807 + z = 807 + 646 = 1453. Define Elephant as J; n = j = 1453; so J = 546 + n = 546 + 1453 = 1999. Define Fox as A; u = J = 1999; so A = 573 + u = 573 + 1999 = 2572. Define Deer as l; b = A = 2572; so l = 867 + b = 867 + 2572 = 3439. Define Raccoon as D; so D = l + J = 3439 + 1999 = 5438. Define Lion as e; H = D + J = 5438 + 1999 = 7437; so e = 868 + H = 868 + 7437 = 8305. Define Bear as S; B = e + A = 8305 + 2572 = 10877; N = B + D = 10877 + 5438 = 16315; so S = 735 + N = 735 + 16315 = 17050. Answer: 17050.
**arguments:**

- the number of lion equals 868 plus the sum of the number of raccoon and the number of elephant.
- the number of raccoon equals the sum of the number of deer and the number of elephant.
- the number of bear equals 735 plus the sum of the number of lion, the number of fox, and the number of raccoon.
- the number of deer equals 867 plus the number of fox.
- the number of tiger equals 646.
- the number of elephant equals 546 plus the number of wolf.
- the number of wolf equals 807 plus the number of tiger.
- the number of fox equals 573 plus the number of elephant.

**calculation:**

1. **calculate the number of raccoon:**
   - the number of raccoon = the sum of the number of deer and the number of elephant
   - the number of raccoon = 867 + 546
   - the number of raccoon = 1413

2. **calculate the number of lion:**
   - the number of lion = 868 + 1413
   - the number of lion = 2271

3. **calculate the number of fox:**
   - the number of fox = 573 + 1413
   - the number of fox = 2086

4. **calculate the number of bear:**
   - the number of bear = 735 + 2271 + 2086
   - the number of bear = 4192

Note: the total number of adult animals in one location refers to sum of all types of adult animals ever mentioned for the specific location throughout the problem EXCLUDING their number of newborn children. IMPORTANT: if the a type of animal is never mentioned for a location for that specific problem, assume its INEXISTENCE in that location (number in the location = 0). Previous problems animal quantities are not applicable for the present one. The average number of newborn children of the same type of animal might vary across different locations. The total newborn animal children of a location refers to the sum of the TOTAL newborn children (not average newborn children) from all adult animals mentioned for that specific location. Hint: the total newborn children of one type of animal in a location equals the average children per that animal in location times the number of that animal in location. Each question is self-contained INDEPENDENT of the others. Quantities of previous problems is NOT correct for the new problem, so quantities of animals MUST be recalculated for each question! Explain your calculation in the detailed step-by-step manner. Please first give out the arguments then the answer. Final answer needs to be presented in the format 'Answer: xxx', where xxx is the number you calculated.

**Arguments:**

- The number of Blue Jay equals 673 plus the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Penguin.
- The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Sparrow, the number of Hawk, and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Sparrow equals 897 plus the number of Hawk.
- The number of Hawk equals 67 plus the number of Eagle.
- The number of Owl equals 830 plus the number of Penguin.
- The number of Parrot equals 862 plus the number of Owl.
- The number of Crow equals 668 plus the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Eagle.
- The number of Eagle equals 332.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Hawk = 67 + 332 = 399
- The number of Sparrow = 897 + 399 = 1296
- The number of Penguin = 1296 + 332 = 1628
- The number of Blue Jay = 673 + 1628 = 2301
- The number of Parrot = 862 + 830 = 1692
- The number of Crow = 668 + 2301 + 332 = 3201

**Answer: 3201**<eos>
Define Eagle as Z; so Z = 332. Define Hawk as x; a = Z = 332; so x = 67 + a = 67 + 332 = 399. Define Sparrow as r; s = x = 399; so r = 897 + s = 897 + 399 = 1296. Define Penguin as k; S = r + x = 1296 + 399 = 1695; so k = S + Z = 1695 + 332 = 2027. Define Owl as e; g = k = 2027; so e = 830 + g = 830 + 2027 = 2857. Define Parrot as E; l = e = 2857; so E = 862 + l = 862 + 2857 = 3719. Define Blue Jay as o; n = E + k = 3719 + 2027 = 5746; so o = 673 + n = 673 + 5746 = 6419. Define Crow as M; U = o + Z = 6419 + 332 = 6751; so M = 668 + U = 668 + 6751 = 7419. Answer: 7419.

- The number of Penguin equals 196 plus the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Crow equals 684 plus the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Eagle, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk equals 496 plus the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Parrot equals 745 plus the number of Crow.
- The number of Blue Jay equals 31.
- The number of Owl equals 616 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Blue Jay.
- The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle equals 881 plus the number of Owl.

**Calculation:**

- The number of Blue Jay is 31.
- The number of Penguin is 196 + 31 = 227.
- The number of Sparrow is the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Owl.
- The number of Eagle is 881 + the number of Owl.
- The number of Sparrow is the sum of 881 + the number of Owl and the number of Owl, which is 881 + 2 * the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot is 745 + the number of Crow.
- The number of Crow is 684 + the sum of the number of Hawk, the number of Eagle, and the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Hawk is 496 + the number of Sparrow.
- The number of Sparrow is 881 + 2 * the number of Owl.
- Therefore, the number of Crow is 684 + (496 + 881 + 2 * the number of Owl) = 1451 + 2 * the number of Owl.
- The number of Parrot is 745 + 1451 + 2 * the number of Owl = 2196 + 2 * the number of Owl.

**Answer: 2196 + 2 * the number of Owl**<eos>
Define Blue Jay as o; so o = 31. Define Penguin as H; A = o = 31; so H = 196 + A = 196 + 31 = 227. Define Owl as t; z = H + o = 227 + 31 = 258; so t = 616 + z = 616 + 258 = 874. Define Eagle as i; Q = t = 874; so i = 881 + Q = 881 + 874 = 1755. Define Sparrow as N; so N = i + t = 1755 + 874 = 2629. Define Hawk as w; m = N = 2629; so w = 496 + m = 496 + 2629 = 3125. Define Crow as R; h = w + i = 3125 + 1755 = 4880; P = h + N = 4880 + 2629 = 7509; so R = 684 + P = 684 + 7509 = 8193. Define Parrot as T; r = R = 8193; so T = 745 + r = 745 + 8193 = 8938. Answer: 8938.
