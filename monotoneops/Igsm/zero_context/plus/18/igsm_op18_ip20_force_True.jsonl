The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Kangaroo and the number of Elephant. The number of Bear equals 26. ", "question": "What is the number of Bat?", "solution": "Define Lion as j; so j = 392. Define Elephant as I; r = j = 392; so I = 686 + r = 686 + 392 = 1078. Define Kangaroo as F; so F = I + j = 1078 + 392 = 1470. Define Raccoon as e; so e = F + I = 1470 + 1078 = 2548. Define Moose as U; o = e = 2548; so U = 352 + o = 352 + 2548 = 2900. Define Wolf as s; so s = U + j = 2900 + 392 = 3292. Define Fox as c; V = s + U = 3292 + 2900 = 6192; so c = V + j = 6192 + 392 = 6584. Define Tiger as B; a = c = 6584; so B = 128 + a = 128 + 6584 = 6712. Define Squirrel as p; q = B + I = 6712 + 1078 = 7790; so p = 863 + q = 863 + 7790 = 8653. Define Rabbit as f; so f = p = 8653. Define Deer as S; d = f = 8653; so S = 237 + d = 237 + 8653 = 8890. Define Bat as O; so O = S + j = 8890 + 392 = 9282.
