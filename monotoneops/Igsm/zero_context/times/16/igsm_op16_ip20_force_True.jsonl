The number of Eagle equals 2 times the number of Parrot. ", "question": "What is the number of Falcon?", "solution": "Define Parrot as l; so l = 1. Define Eagle as w; Y = l = 1; so w = 2 * Y = 2 * 1 = 2. Define Penguin as Q; d = w * l = 2 * 1 = 2; so Q = 2 * d = 2 * 2 = 4. Define Peacock as O; so O = Q = 4. Define Owl as m; y = O * w = 4 * 2 = 8; so m = 2 * y = 2 * 8 = 16. Define Hawk as T; so T = m = 16. Define Crow as N; c = T * Q = 16 * 4 = 64; so N = 1 * c = 1 * 64 = 64. Define Blue Jay as S; u = N * O = 64 * 4 = 256; so S = 2 * u = 2 * 256 = 512. Define Sparrow as M; so M = S * w = 512 * 2 = 1024. Define Falcon as r; o = M = 1024; so r = 2 * o = 2 * 1024 = 2048.
