This means that the number of Deer is also equal to 2 times the number of Wolf.\n\nNow, we are given that the number of Wolf equals 1 times the product of the number of Fox and the number of Deer.

Since the number of Elephant equals 4, the number of Deer equals 2, and the number of Wolf equals 2, the number of Raccoon equals 4 * 2 * 2 = 16.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of Bear\nThe number of Bear equals the product of the number of Raccoon, the number of Elephant, and the number of Wolf. Since the number of Raccoon equals 16, the number of Elephant equals 4, and the number of Wolf equals 2, the number of Bear equals 16 * 4 * 2 = 128.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of Fox\nThe number of Fox equals the product of the number of Bear, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Wolf. Since the number of Bear equals 128, the number of Raccoon equals 16, and the number of Wolf equals 2, the number of Fox equals 128 * 16 * 2 = 4096.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4096}$"

The number of Owl equals 1 times the product of the number of Hawk, the number of Crow, and the number of Parrot.\n   Since the number of Hawk equals 4P, the number of Crow equals 2, and the number of Parrot equals P, the number of Owl equals 1 * 4P * 2 * P = 8P^2.\n6.

Since the number of Parrot equals B, and the number of Blue Jay equals B, we can say that the number of Parrot equals the number of Blue Jay. We already know that the number of Blue Jay equals 2. Therefore, the number of Parrot equals 2.\n\nNow that we know the number of Parrot equals 2, we can substitute this value into the equation for the number of Hawk: 4P = 4 * 2 = 8. Therefore, P = 2.\n\nNow that we know P = 2, we can substitute this value into the equation for the number of Eagle: 32P^2 = 32 * 2^2 = 32 * 4 = 128.\n\nThe final answer is: 128"

Therefore, the number of Bear also equals 8.\n\n## Step 4: Find the number of Deer\nThe number of Deer equals 2 times the product of the number of Bear and the number of Raccoon. Since the number of Bear equals 8 and the number of Raccoon equals 2, the number of Deer equals 2 * 8 * 2 = 64.\n\n## Step 5: Find the number of Tiger\nThe number of Tiger equals 2 times the product of the number of Deer and the number of Wolf. Since the number of Deer equals 64 and the number of Wolf equals 2, the number of Tiger equals 2 * 64 * 2 = 256.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{256}$"

            "## Step 1: Determine the number of Sparrow\nThe number of Sparrow equals 1 times the number of Crow. Since the number of Crow equals 2 times the number of Sparrow, we can substitute this into the equation to get the number of Sparrow. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S. Then, S = 1 * 2S, which simplifies to S = 2S. However, this is a circular reference since the number of Crow is defined in terms of the number of Sparrow, and vice versa. We need to break this cycle by looking at other equations.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of Penguin\nThe number of Penguin equals 2 times the number of Sparrow. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S. Then, the number of Penguin equals 2S.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of Eagle\nThe number of Eagle equals 1 times the product of the number of Penguin and the number of Sparrow. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S and the number of Penguin as 2S. Then, the number of Eagle equals 1 * (2S) * S = 2S^2.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of Owl\nThe number of Owl equals 2 times the product of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Penguin. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S, the number of Penguin as 2S, and the number of Eagle as 2S^2. Then, the number of Owl equals 2 * (2S^2) * S * 2S = 8S^4.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of Blue Jay\nThe number of Blue Jay equals the product of the number of Eagle and the number of Hawk. However, we do not have the number of Hawk yet. We will come back to this equation later.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the number of Parrot\nThe number of Parrot equals the product of the number of Penguin, the number of Owl, and the number of Sparrow. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S, the number of Penguin as 2S, and the number of Owl as 8S^4. Then, the number of Parrot equals 2S * 8S^4 * S = 16S^6.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the number of Hawk\nThe number of Hawk equals the product of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Penguin. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S, the number of Penguin as 2S, the number of Eagle as 2S^2, and the number of Owl as 8S^4. Then, the number of Hawk equals 8S^4 * 2S^2 * S * 2S = 32S^8.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the number of Crow\nThe number of Crow equals 2 times the number of Sparrow. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S. Then, the number of Crow equals 2S.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the number of Sparrow using the number of Crow\nThe number of Sparrow equals 1 times the number of Crow. Let's denote the number of Crow as 2S. Then, the number of Sparrow equals 1 * 2S = 2S.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for S\nWe have two equations for the number of Sparrow: S = 2S and S = 2S. However, we can use the equation from step 2 to determine the number of Sparrow. The number of Penguin equals 2 times the number of Sparrow. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S. Then, the number of Penguin equals 2S. We can use this equation to solve for S.\n\n## Step 11: Solve for S using the number of Penguin\nThe number of Penguin equals 2 times the number of Sparrow. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S. Then, the number of Penguin equals 2S. We also know that the number of Penguin equals 2 times the number of Sparrow. Therefore, 2S = 2S. However, we can use the equation from step 3 to determine the number of Sparrow. The number of Eagle equals 1 times the product of the number of Penguin and the number of Sparrow. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S and the number of Penguin as 2S. Then, the number of Eagle equals 1 * (2S) * S = 2S^2.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for S using the number of Eagle\nThe number of Eagle equals 1 times the product of the number of Penguin and the number of Sparrow. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S and the number of Penguin as 2S. Then, the number of Eagle equals 1 * (2S) * S = 2S^2. We also know that the number of Eagle equals 2 times the product of the number of Sparrow. Therefore, 2S^2 = 2S^2. However, we can use the equation from step 4 to determine the number of Sparrow. The number of Owl equals 2 times the product of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Penguin. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S, the number of Penguin as 2S, and the number of Eagle as 2S^2. Then, the number of Owl equals 2 * (2S^2) * S * 2S = 8S^5.\n\n## Step 13: Solve for S using the number of Owl\nThe number of Owl equals 2 times the product of the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Penguin. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S, the number of Penguin as 2S, and the number of Eagle as 2S^2. Then, the number of Owl equals 2 * (2S^2) * S * 2S = 8S^5. We also know that the number of Owl equals 8S^4. Therefore, 8S^5 = 8S^4. Dividing both sides by 8S^4, we get S = 1.\n\n## Step 14: Determine the number of Hawk\nThe number of Hawk equals the product of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Penguin. Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S, the number of Penguin as 2S, the number of Eagle as 2S^2, and the number of Owl as 8S^4. Then, the number of Hawk equals 8S^4 * 2S^2 * S * 2S = 32S^8. We have determined that S = 1. Therefore, the number of Hawk equals 32(1)^8 = 32.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{32}$"

The number of Blue Jay equals the product of the number of Hawk and the number of Crow.\n   Let's denote the number of Blue Jay as Bj. Then, Bj = H * C.\n\n8. The number of Sparrow equals the product of the number of Penguin, the number of Owl, and the number of Parrot.\n   Let's denote the number of Sparrow as Sp. Then, Sp = P * O * Pp.\n\nNow, let's substitute the given values and relationships into the equations:\n\n1. P = 2 * Pp * O\n2. E = 2\n3. C = Sp\n4. H = C\n5. O = E\n6. Pp = 2 * O * E\n7. Bj = H * C\n8. Sp = P * O * Pp\n\nFrom equation 5, we know that O = 2. From equation 6, we can substitute O = 2 into Pp = 2 * O * E to get Pp = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\nFrom equation 1, we can substitute Pp = 8 and O = 2 into P = 2 * Pp * O to get P = 2 * 8 * 2 = 32.\n\nFrom equation 8, we can substitute P = 32, O = 2, and Pp = 8 into Sp = P * O * Pp to get Sp = 32 * 2 * 8 = 512.\n\nFrom equation 3, we know that C = Sp, so C = 512.\n\nFrom equation 4, we know that H = C, so H = 512.\n\nFrom equation 7, we can substitute H = 512 and C = 512 into Bj = H * C to get Bj = 512 * 512 = 262144.\n\nTherefore, the number of Blue Jay is 262144."

            "To find the number of Hawk, we need to follow the given equations step by step.\n\nGiven:\n1. The number of Crow equals 2 times the product of the number of Eagle and the number of Parrot.\n   Let's denote the number of Crow as C, the number of Eagle as E, and the number of Parrot as P. Then, C = 2EP.\n\n2. The number of Owl equals 1 times the product of the number of Sparrow and the number of Parrot.\n   Let's denote the number of Owl as O. Then, O = SP.\n\n3. The number of Sparrow equals the product of the number of Blue Jay, the number of Crow, and the number of Eagle.\n   Let's denote the number of Sparrow as S. Then, S = BC E.\n\n4.

Since P = 1, O = S.\n\nFrom equation 3, we have S = BC E. Since B = C and E = 1, S = C^2.\n\nFrom equation 1, we have C = 2EP. Since E = 1 and P = 1, C = 2.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of C into the equation for S: S = C^2 = 2^2 = 4.\n\nSince O = S, O = 4.\n\nFinally, we can substitute the values of O and B into the equation for H: H = OB = 4 * 2 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the number of Hawk is 8."

Since the number of Fox equals 2, the number of Elephant equals 1 * 2 = 2.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of Wolf\nThe number of Wolf equals the product of the number of Raccoon, the number of Fox, and the number of Elephant. We already know the number of Fox equals 2 and the number of Elephant equals 2. We need to find the number of Raccoon first.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of Raccoon\nThe number of Raccoon equals 2 times the product of the number of Elephant and the number of Fox. Since the number of Elephant equals 2 and the number of Fox equals 2, the number of Raccoon equals 2 * (2 * 2) = 2 * 4 = 8.\n\n## Step 4: Continue determining the number of Wolf\nNow that we know the number of Raccoon equals 8, the number of Fox equals 2, and the number of Elephant equals 2, we can find the number of Wolf. The number of Wolf equals 8 * 2 * 2 = 32.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of Deer\nThe number of Deer equals 1 times the product of the number of Wolf, the number of Elephant, and the number of Fox. Since the number of Wolf equals 32, the number of Elephant equals 2, and the number of Fox equals 2, the number of Deer equals 1 * (32 * 2 * 2) = 1 * 128 = 128.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the number of Bear\nThe number of Bear equals 2 times the number of Deer. Since the number of Deer equals 128, the number of Bear equals 2 * 128 = 256.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the number of Tiger\nThe number of Tiger equals 1 times the number of Bear. Since the number of Bear equals 256, the number of Tiger equals 1 * 256 = 256.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{256}$"

            "To find the number of Elephant, we need to work backwards from the given information.\n\n## Step 1: Find the number of Bear\nThe number of Bear equals 2 times the number of Tiger. We don't know the number of Tiger yet, so we'll come back to this.\n\n## Step 2: Find the number of Tiger\nThe number of Tiger equals the product of the number of Raccoon, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer. We know the number of Deer is 1. We also know the number of Wolf equals 1 times the number of Deer, so the number of Wolf is 1. We'll come back to the number of Raccoon.\n\n## Step 3: Find the number of Raccoon\nThe number of Raccoon equals the product of the number of Fox and the number of Wolf. We know the number of Wolf is 1. We also know the number of Fox equals 1 times the product of the number of Wolf and the number of Deer. Since the number of Deer is 1 and the number of Wolf is 1, the number of Fox is 1. Therefore, the number of Raccoon is 1.\n\n## Step 4: Find the number of Tiger\nNow that we know the number of Raccoon is 1, the number of Wolf is 1, and the number of Deer is 1, we can find the number of Tiger. The number of Tiger equals the product of the number of Raccoon, the number of Wolf, and the number of Deer, which is 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.\n\n## Step 5: Find the number of Bear\nNow that we know the number of Tiger is 1, we can find the number of Bear.

We still don't know the number of Hawk. However, we can find the number of Hawk from the equation \"The number of Hawk equals 1 times the number of Penguin\" and \"The number of Penguin equals 1 times the number of Parrot\".\n    Since the number of Parrot is 8, the number of Penguin is 8, and the number of Hawk is 8.\n\n11. Now we can find the number of Eagle.\n    The number of Eagle is 256 * Hawk^2 = 256 * 8^2 = 256 * 64 = 16384.\n\nThe final answer is: 16384"

The number of Wolf equals 2 times the number of Tiger.\n8. The number of Fox equals 1 times the number of Deer.\n9. The number of Elephant equals the product of the number of Horse and the number of Bear.\n\nFrom equation 7, we know that the number of Wolf equals 2 times the number of Tiger. Since the number of Tiger equals 2 (equation 4), the number of Wolf equals 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nFrom equation 6, we know that the number of Bear equals 2 times the number of Fox. Since the number of Fox equals the number of Deer (equation 8), and the number of Deer equals 1 times the product of the number of Raccoon and the number of Tiger (equation 5), we can find the number of Deer as follows:\nThe number of Raccoon equals the product of the number of Wolf and the number of Tiger (equation 2). Since the number of Wolf equals 4 and the number of Tiger equals 2, the number of Raccoon equals 4 * 2 = 8.\nThe number of Deer equals 1 times the product of the number of Raccoon and the number of Tiger (equation 5). Therefore, the number of Deer equals 8 * 2 = 16.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Bear. The number of Bear equals 2 times the number of Fox (equation 6). Since the number of Fox equals the number of Deer (equation 8), the number of Bear equals 2 * 16 = 32.\n\nFrom equation 9, we know that the number of Elephant equals the product of the number of Horse and the number of Bear. Since the number of Bear equals 32, we need to find the number of Horse to find the number of Elephant.\n\nFrom equation 1, we know that the number of Horse equals the product of the number of Bear, the number of Deer, and the number of Wolf. We already know the number of Bear (32), the number of Deer (16), and the number of Wolf (4). Therefore, the number of Horse equals 32 * 16 * 4 = 2048.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Elephant. The number of Elephant equals the product of the number of Horse and the number of Bear (equation 9). Therefore, the number of Elephant equals 2048 * 32 = 65536.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of Lion. The number of Lion equals 1 times the number of Elephant (equation 3).

Since the number of Parrot is 1, the number of Blue Jay is equal to the product of the number of Owl, the number of Parrot, and the number of Hawk. \n\nThe number of Parrot is 1, so the number of Blue Jay is equal to the product of the number of Owl and the number of Hawk. \n\nThe number of Sparrow equals 2 times the number of Hawk, and the number of Owl equals 1 times the number of Sparrow. Therefore, the number of Owl equals 2 times the number of Hawk. \n\nThe number of Blue Jay equals the product of the number of Owl, the number of Parrot, and the number of Hawk. Since the number of Parrot is 1, the number of Blue Jay equals the product of the number of Owl and the number of Hawk. \n\nThe number of Owl equals 2 times the number of Hawk, so the number of Blue Jay equals 2 times the number of Hawk squared. \n\nThe number of Hawk equals 1 times the number of Parrot, which is 1. Therefore, the number of Blue Jay equals 2 times 1 squared, which is 2.\n\nThe number of Eagle equals the number of Blue Jay, which is 2. \n\nThe number of Crow equals 1 times the number of Eagle, which is 2. \n\nThe number of Penguin equals 2 times the product of the number of Crow and the number of Parrot. Since the number of Parrot is 1, the number of Penguin equals 2 times the number of Crow. \n\nThe number of Crow is 2, so the number of Penguin equals 2 times 2, which is 4.\n\nThe number of Peacock equals the product of the number of Penguin and the number of Crow. \n\nThe number of Penguin is 4, and the number of Crow is 2. Therefore, the number of Peacock equals 4 times 2, which is 8.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$"

The number of Wolf equals 2 times the number of Kangaroo.\n\nFrom equation 9, we know that the number of Horse equals 2.\n\nFrom equation 7, we know that the number of Raccoon equals 1 times the number of Horse, so the number of Raccoon equals 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nFrom equation 11, we know that the number of Rabbit equals the product of the number of Lion, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Horse. We can substitute the values we know: the number of Lion equals 2 times the product of the number of Raccoon and the number of Horse (equation 5), so the number of Lion equals 2 * (2 * 2) = 8. The number of Rabbit equals 8 * 2 * 2 = 32.\n\nFrom equation 10, we know that the number of Moose equals 2 times the number of Rabbit, so the number of Moose equals 2 * 32 = 64.\n\nFrom equation 14, we know that the number of Deer equals the product of the number of Moose, the number of Lion, and the number of Horse. We can substitute the values we know: the number of Moose equals 64, the number of Lion equals 8, and the number of Horse equals 2, so the number of Deer equals 64 * 8 * 2 = 1024.\n\nFrom equation 12, we know that the number of Fox equals the product of the number of Deer, the number of Rabbit, and the number of Moose. We can substitute the values we know: the number of Deer equals 1024, the number of Rabbit equals 32, and the number of Moose equals 64, so the number of Fox equals 1024 * 32 * 64 = 2,097,152.\n\nFrom equation 8, we know that the number of Squirrel equals the number of Fox, so the number of Squirrel equals 2,097,152.\n\nFrom equation 13, we know that the number of Bat equals 2 times the product of the number of Squirrel and the number of Lion. We can substitute the values we know: the number of Squirrel equals 2,097,152, and the number of Lion equals 8, so the number of Bat equals 2 * 2,097,152 * 8 = 33,529,536.\n\nTherefore, the number of Bat is 33,529,536."

The number of Deer equals 2 times the product of the number of Elephant and the number of Fox. Let's denote Deer as D. So, D = 2 * E * F.\n4. The number of Bear equals 2 times the product of the number of Deer and the number of Tiger. So, B = 2 * D * T.\n5. The number of Raccoon equals 1 times the product of the number of Lion, the number of Elephant, and the number of Tiger. Let's denote Raccoon as R. So, R = L * E * T.\n6.

So, W = R * E * L * F.\n\nNow, let's substitute the given values and equations into the solution:\n\nFrom equation 7, we know T = 2. From equation 1, we know F = T, so F = 2.\n\nFrom equation 6, we know E = F, so E = 2.\n\nFrom equation 2, we know L = B. From equation 4, we know B = 2 * D * T.

Substituting E = 2 and F = 2, we get D = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\nNow, we can find B: B = 4 * D = 4 * 8 = 32.\n\nFrom equation 2, we know L = B, so L = 32.\n\nFrom equation 5, we know R = L * E * T. Substituting L = 32, E = 2, and T = 2, we get R = 32 * 2 * 2 = 128.\n\nNow, we can find W: W = R * E * L * F = 128 * 2 * 32 * 2 = 8192.\n\nTherefore, the number of Wolf is 8192."

The number of Eagle equals the product of the number of Penguin, the number of Sparrow, the number of Dove, and the number of Blue Jay. Since the number of Penguin equals 1, the number of Sparrow equals 1, the number of Dove equals 1, and the number of Blue Jay equals 1, the number of Eagle equals the product of 1, 1, 1, and 1, which equals 1.\n\n## Step 4: Use the given relationships to find the number of Hawk.\nThe number of Hawk equals 1 times the number of Eagle. Since the number of Eagle equals 1, the number of Hawk also equals 1 times 1, which equals 1.\n\n## Step 5: Use the given relationships to find the number of Owl.\nThe number of Owl equals the product of the number of Parrot and the number of Hawk. Since the number of Parrot equals the number of Peacock, and the number of Peacock equals the number of Crow, the number of Parrot equals the number of Crow. The number of Crow equals 1 times the number of Hawk, so the number of Parrot equals 1 times the number of Hawk. Since the number of Hawk equals 1, the number of Parrot equals 1 times 1, which equals 1. The number of Owl equals the product of the number of Parrot and the number of Hawk. Since the number of Parrot equals 1 and the number of Hawk equals 1, the number of Owl equals the product of 1 and 1, which equals 1.\n\n## Step 6: Use the given relationships to find the number of Cardinal.\nThe number of Cardinal equals the product of the number of Owl and the number of Penguin. Since the number of Owl equals 1 and the number of Penguin equals 1, the number of Cardinal equals the product of 1 and 1, which equals 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"

The number of Swan equals 2 times the number of Eagle.\nThe number of Eagle equals the product of the number of Crow and the number of Dove.\nThe number of Crow equals 1 times the number of Dove.\nSo, the number of Eagle equals 2 (number of Dove) times 2 (number of Dove) = 4.\nNow, the number of Swan equals 2 times 4 (number of Eagle) = 8.\nNow, the number of Cardinal equals 8 (number of Swan) times 2 (number of Dove) = 16.\n\n## Step 3: Find the number of Woodpecker\nThe number of Woodpecker equals 1 times the product of the number of Parrot and the number of Hawk.\nFirst, we need to find the number of Parrot.

            "## Step 1: Determine the number of Deer\nThe number of Deer equals 1 times the number of Wolf. However, we first need to find the number of Wolf, which is 2 times the number of Raccoon. But to find the number of Raccoon, we need to know the number of Fox, which in turn requires the number of Horse and Elephant. Let's start with what we know: the number of Elephant equals 2.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the number of Horse\nThe number of Horse equals 1 times the number of Elephant. Since the number of Elephant equals 2, the number of Horse also equals 2.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of Wolf\nThe number of Wolf equals 2 times the number of Raccoon. However, we need to find the number of Raccoon, which requires the number of Fox. To find the number of Fox, we need the number of Horse and Elephant, which we know are both 2. The number of Fox equals 2 times the product of the number of Horse and the number of Elephant, so the number of Fox equals 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of Raccoon\nThe number of Raccoon equals 2 times the product of the number of Fox and the number of Elephant. Since the number of Fox equals 8 and the number of Elephant equals 2, the number of Raccoon equals 2 * 8 * 2 = 32.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the number of Wolf\nThe number of Wolf equals 2 times the number of Raccoon. Since the number of Raccoon equals 32, the number of Wolf equals 2 * 32 = 64.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the number of Deer\nThe number of Deer equals 1 times the number of Wolf. Since the number of Wolf equals 64, the number of Deer also equals 64.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the number of Tiger\nThe number of Tiger equals the product of the number of Lion and the number of Deer. However, we need to find the number of Lion first, which requires the number of Deer, Raccoon, Fox, and Elephant. Let's continue with what we know: the number of Deer equals 64.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the number of Lion\nThe number of Lion equals the product of the number of Deer, the number of Raccoon, the number of Fox, and the number of Elephant. Since the number of Deer equals 64, the number of Raccoon equals 32, the number of Fox equals 8, and the number of Elephant equals 2, the number of Lion equals 64 * 32 * 8 * 2 = 8192.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the number of Tiger\nThe number of Tiger equals the product of the number of Lion and the number of Deer. Since the number of Lion equals 8192 and the number of Deer equals 64, the number of Tiger equals 8192 * 64 = 524,288.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the number of Bear\nThe number of Bear equals the product of the number of Tiger, the number of Deer, and the number of Horse. Since the number of Tiger equals 524,288, the number of Deer equals 64, and the number of Horse equals 2, the number of Bear equals 524,288 * 64 * 2 = 67,092,416.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{67092416}$"

We will come back to this equation later.\n\n## Step 9: Find the number of Tiger\nThe number of Tiger equals 1.\n\n## Step 10: Find the number of Elephant\nThe number of Elephant equals 1.\n\n## Step 11: Find the number of Leopard\nThe number of Leopard equals the product of the number of Elephant and the number of Tiger. So, the number of Leopard = 1 * 1 = 1.\n\n## Step 12: Find the number of Raccoon (continued)\nThe number of Moose equals the product of the number of Bear, the number of Kangaroo, the number of Rabbit, and the number of Lion. So, the number of Moose = 8 * 4 * 4 * 1 = 512. The number of Raccoon equals 2 times the number of Moose. So, the number of Raccoon = 2 * 512 = 1024.\n\n## Step 13: Find the number of Deer (continued)\nThe number of Deer equals the product of the number of Raccoon, the number of Rabbit, and the number of Lion. So, the number of Deer = 1024 * 4 * 1 = 4096.\n\n## Step 14: Find the number of Wolf\nThe number of Wolf equals the product of the number of Deer and the number of Lion. So, the number of Wolf = 4096 * 1 = 4096.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4096}$"

The number of Horse equals the number of Wolf.\n5. The number of Bear equals 2.\n\nFrom (5), we know the number of Bear is 2.\n\nFrom (4), we know the number of Horse is equal to the number of Wolf.\n\nFrom (3), we know the number of Fox is equal to the product of the number of Horse and the number of Wolf. Since the number of Horse is equal to the number of Wolf, the number of Fox is equal to the product of the number of Wolf and the number of Wolf, which is the square of the number of Wolf.\n\nFrom (1), we know the number of Deer is equal to the product of the number of Fox, the number of Bear, and the number of Horse. Since the number of Horse is equal to the number of Wolf, and the number of Bear is 2, the number of Deer is equal to the product of the number of Fox, 2, and the number of Wolf.\n\nSince the number of Fox is the square of the number of Wolf, we can substitute this into the equation for the number of Deer: the number of Deer is equal to the product of the square of the number of Wolf, 2, and the number of Wolf.\n\nThe number of Wolf is equal to the product of the number of Moose, the number of Lion, and the number of Kangaroo. The number of Moose is equal to the number of Elephant, and the number of Elephant is equal to the number of Tiger. The number of Tiger is equal to the number of Kangaroo, which is 2 times the number of Lion. The number of Lion is equal to the number of Bear, which is 2.\n\nSo, the number of Wolf is equal to the product of the number of Moose, the number of Lion, and the number of Kangaroo. Since the number of Moose is equal to the number of Elephant, and the number of Elephant is equal to the number of Tiger, and the number of Tiger is equal to the number of Kangaroo, which is 2 times the number of Lion, and the number of Lion is 2, the number of Wolf is equal to the product of 2, 2, and 2 times 2, which is 16.\n\nNow that we know the number of Wolf is 16, we can find the number of Fox, which is the square of the number of Wolf. The number of Fox is 16 squared, which is 256.\n\nNow that we know the number of Fox is 256, we can find the number of Deer, which is the product of the number of Fox, 2, and the number of Wolf. The number of Deer is 256 times 2 times 16, which is 8192.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of Raccoon, which is 2 times the number of Deer. The number of Raccoon is 2 times 8192, which is 16384.\n\nThe final answer is: 16384"

            "To find the number of Eagle, we need to work backwards from the given equations.\n\n## Step 1: Find the number of Crow\nThe number of Crow equals the number of Penguin. Since the number of Penguin equals 2 times the number of Hawk, and the number of Hawk equals the number of Owl, we can start by finding the number of Owl.\n\n## Step 2: Find the number of Owl\nThe number of Owl equals the product of the number of Parrot, the number of Peacock, and the number of Cardinal. We know that the number of Parrot equals 2 times the number of Cardinal, and the number of Cardinal equals 2 times the product of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Peacock.\n\n## Step 3: Find the number of Peacock\nThe number of Peacock equals 2 times the number of Falcon. The number of Falcon equals 2 times the number of Sparrow, and the number of Sparrow equals 1.\n\n## Step 4: Find the number of Blue Jay\nThe number of Blue Jay equals the product of the number of Peacock and the number of Sparrow. Since the number of Sparrow equals 1, the number of Blue Jay equals the number of Peacock.\n\n## Step 5: Find the number of Cardinal\nThe number of Cardinal equals 2 times the product of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Peacock. Since the number of Blue Jay equals the number of Peacock, the number of Cardinal equals 2 times the number of Peacock squared.\n\n## Step 6: Find the number of Owl\nNow that we know the number of Cardinal, we can find the number of Owl. The number of Owl equals the product of the number of Parrot, the number of Peacock, and the number of Cardinal. Since the number of Parrot equals 2 times the number of Cardinal, the number of Owl equals 2 times the product of the number of Peacock and the number of Cardinal.\n\n## Step 7: Find the number of Penguin\nThe number of Penguin equals 2 times the number of Hawk. Since the number of Hawk equals the number of Owl, the number of Penguin equals 2 times the number of Owl.\n\n## Step 8: Find the number of Crow\nThe number of Crow equals the number of Penguin.\n\n## Step 9: Find the number of Eagle\nThe number of Eagle equals 1 times the number of Crow.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the number of Eagle\nNow that we have all the necessary values, we can calculate the number of Eagle. The number of Peacock equals 2 times the number of Falcon, and the number of Falcon equals 2 times the number of Sparrow. Since the number of Sparrow equals 1, the number of Falcon equals 2, and the number of Peacock equals 4. The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Peacock, which equals 4. The number of Cardinal equals 2 times the product of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Peacock, which equals 2 times 4 times 4, or 32. The number of Parrot equals 2 times the number of Cardinal, which equals 64. The number of Owl equals the product of the number of Parrot, the number of Peacock, and the number of Cardinal, which equals 64 times 4 times 32, or 8192. The number of Penguin equals 2 times the number of Hawk, and the number of Hawk equals the number of Owl, so the number of Penguin equals 2 times 8192, or 16384. The number of Crow equals the number of Penguin, which equals 16384. The number of Eagle equals 1 times the number of Crow, which equals 16384.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16384}$"

The number of Raccoon equals 1 times the number of Moose.\n3. The number of Elephant equals the product of the number of Bat and the number of Lion.\n4. The number of Fox equals 1 times the number of Monkey.\n5. The number of Kangaroo equals the product of the number of Horse, the number of Otter, and the number of Moose.\n6. The number of Wolf equals 2 times the number of Kangaroo.\n7. The number of Bat equals 2 times the number of Lion.\n8. The number of Squirrel equals 2 times the number of Leopard.\n9. The number of Lion equals 1 times the number of Deer.\n10. The number of Monkey equals 2.\n11. The number of Tiger equals the number of Squirrel.\n12. The number of Otter equals the product of the number of Tiger, the number of Squirrel, and the number of Moose.\n13. The number of Leopard equals 1 times the number of Coyote.\n14. The number of Rabbit equals the product of the number of Bear, the number of Leopard, and the number of Otter.\n15. The number of Bear equals the number of Horse.\n16. The number of Deer equals the product of the number of Raccoon and the number of Moose.\n17. The number of Moose equals the number of Fox.\n18. The number of Coyote equals the number of Deer.\n\nFrom point 18, we know that the number of Coyote equals the number of Deer. From point 16, we know that the number of Deer equals the product of the number of Raccoon and the number of Moose. Since the number of Moose equals the number of Fox (point 17), we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Deer = Number of Raccoon * Number of Fox\n\nFrom point 2, we know that the number of Raccoon equals 1 times the number of Moose. Since the number of Moose equals the number of Fox, we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Deer = Number of Fox * Number of Fox\n\nNumber of Deer = (Number of Fox)^2\n\nFrom point 4, we know that the number of Fox equals 1 times the number of Monkey. Since the number of Monkey equals 2 (point 10), we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Fox = 2\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the number of Deer, we get:\n\nNumber of Deer = (2)^2\nNumber of Deer = 4\n\nFrom point 9, we know that the number of Lion equals 1 times the number of Deer. Since the number of Deer equals 4, we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Lion = 4\n\nFrom point 7, we know that the number of Bat equals 2 times the number of Lion. Since the number of Lion equals 4, we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Bat = 2 * 4\nNumber of Bat = 8\n\nFrom point 3, we know that the number of Elephant equals the product of the number of Bat and the number of Lion. Since the number of Bat equals 8 and the number of Lion equals 4, we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Elephant = 8 * 4\nNumber of Elephant = 32\n\nFrom point 11, we know that the number of Tiger equals the number of Squirrel. From point 8, we know that the number of Squirrel equals 2 times the number of Leopard. From point 13, we know that the number of Leopard equals 1 times the number of Coyote. From point 18, we know that the number of Coyote equals the number of Deer. Since the number of Deer equals 4, we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Leopard = 4\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the number of Squirrel, we get:\n\nNumber of Squirrel = 2 * 4\nNumber of Squirrel = 8\n\nSince the number of Tiger equals the number of Squirrel, we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Tiger = 8\n\nFrom point 12, we know that the number of Otter equals the product of the number of Tiger, the number of Squirrel, and the number of Moose. Since the number of Tiger equals 8, the number of Squirrel equals 8, and the number of Moose equals the number of Fox (which equals 2), we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Otter = 8 * 8 * 2\nNumber of Otter = 128\n\nFrom point 1, we know that the number of Horse equals 1 times the number of Otter. Since the number of Otter equals 128, we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Horse = 128\n\nFrom point 15, we know that the number of Bear equals the number of Horse. Since the number of Horse equals 128, we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Bear = 128\n\nFrom point 14, we know that the number of Rabbit equals the product of the number of Bear, the number of Leopard, and the number of Otter. Since the number of Bear equals 128, the number of Leopard equals 4, and the number of Otter equals 128, we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Rabbit = 128 * 4 * 128\nNumber of Rabbit = 65536\n\nFrom point 5, we know that the number of Kangaroo equals the product of the number of Horse, the number of Otter, and the number of Moose. Since the number of Horse equals 128, the number of Otter equals 128, and the number of Moose equals the number of Fox (which equals 2), we can substitute this into the equation to get:\n\nNumber of Kangaroo = 128 * 128 * 2\nNumber of Kangaroo = 32768\n\nThe final answer is: 32768"

            "To find the number of Deer, we need to work backwards from the given equations.\n\nGiven:\n1. The number of Fox equals 1 times the number of Wolf.\n2. The number of Wolf equals 1 times the product of the number of Tiger and the number of Elephant.\n3. The number of Kangaroo equals the product of the number of Raccoon, the number of Horse, and the number of Bear.\n4. The number of Tiger equals the product of the number of Elephant, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Bear.\n5. The number of Raccoon equals 2 times the number of Lion.\n6. The number of Deer equals 2 times the number of Fox.\n7. The number of Elephant equals 1 times the product of the number of Kangaroo and the number of Lion.\n8. The number of Bear equals 1 times the number of Horse.\n9. The number of Lion equals 2 times the number of Bear.\n10. The number of Horse equals 2.\n\nFrom equation 9, we know that the number of Lion equals 2 times the number of Bear. Since the number of Bear equals 1 times the number of Horse (equation 8), we can substitute to get:\nNumber of Lion = 2 * (1 * Number of Horse)\n= 2 * Number of Horse\n= 2 * 2\n= 4\n\nFrom equation 5, we know that the number of Raccoon equals 2 times the number of Lion. So:\nNumber of Raccoon = 2 * Number of Lion\n= 2 * 4\n= 8\n\nFrom equation 4, we know that the number of Tiger equals the product of the number of Elephant, the number of Raccoon, and the number of Bear. Since the number of Bear equals 1 times the number of Horse (equation 8), we can substitute to get:\nNumber of Tiger = Number of Elephant * Number of Raccoon * (1 * Number of Horse)\n= Number of Elephant * 8 * 2\n\nFrom equation 7, we know that the number of Elephant equals 1 times the product of the number of Kangaroo and the number of Lion. So:\nNumber of Elephant = 1 * (Number of Kangaroo * Number of Lion)\n= Number of Kangaroo * 4\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get:\nNumber of Tiger = (Number of Kangaroo * 4) * 8 * 2\n= 64 * Number of Kangaroo\n\nFrom equation 3, we know that the number of Kangaroo equals the product of the number of Raccoon, the number of Horse, and the number of Bear. Since the number of Bear equals 1 times the number of Horse (equation 8), we can substitute to get:\nNumber of Kangaroo = Number of Raccoon * Number of Horse * (1 * Number of Horse)\n= 8 * 2 * 2\n= 32\n\nNow we can substitute this into the previous equation to get:\nNumber of Tiger = 64 * 32\n= 2048\n\nFrom equation 2, we know that the number of Wolf equals 1 times the product of the number of Tiger and the number of Elephant. So:\nNumber of Wolf = 1 * Number of Tiger * Number of Elephant\n= 2048 * (Number of Kangaroo * 4)\n= 2048 * 32 * 4\n= 262144\n\nFrom equation 1, we know that the number of Fox equals 1 times the number of Wolf. So:\nNumber of Fox = 1 * Number of Wolf\n= 262144\n\nFrom equation 6, we know that the number of Deer equals 2 times the number of Fox. So:\nNumber of Deer = 2 * Number of Fox\n= 2 * 262144\n= 524288\n\nThe final answer is: 524288"

Since the number of Coyote equals 2 times the number of Leopard, and the number of Leopard equals 1 times the number of Bat, and the number of Bat equals the number of Tiger, which equals 2, we can find the number of Coyote as 2 * 1 * 2 = 4. Therefore, the number of Squirrel equals 1 * 4 = 4.\n\n## Step 2: Find the number of Elephant\nThe number of Elephant equals 1 times the number of Squirrel. Since we found the number of Squirrel to be 4, the number of Elephant equals 1 * 4 = 4.\n\n## Step 3: Find the number of Horse\nThe number of Horse equals the product of the number of Elephant and the number of Tiger. Since the number of Elephant equals 4 and the number of Tiger equals 2, the number of Horse equals 4 * 2 = 8.\n\n## Step 4: Find the number of Otter\nThe number of Otter equals the product of the number of Horse and the number of Bat. Since the number of Horse equals 8 and the number of Bat equals 2, the number of Otter equals 8 * 2 = 16.\n\n## Step 5: Find the number of Lion\nThe number of Lion equals 2 times the product of the number of Otter, the number of Horse, and the number of Coyote. Since the number of Otter equals 16, the number of Horse equals 8, and the number of Coyote equals 4, the number of Lion equals 2 * (16 * 8 * 4) = 2 * 512 = 1024.\n\n## Step 6: Find the number of Kangaroo\nThe number of Kangaroo equals 2 times the product of the number of Lion and the number of Horse. Since the number of Lion equals 1024 and the number of Horse equals 8, the number of Kangaroo equals 2 * (1024 * 8) = 2 * 8192 = 16384.\n\n## Step 7: Find the number of Monkey\nThe number of Monkey equals 1 times the number of Kangaroo. Since we found the number of Kangaroo to be 16384, the number of Monkey equals 1 * 16384 = 16384.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16384}$"

            "To find the number of Deer, we need to follow the given equations step by step.\n\n1. The number of Bat equals 2 times the number of Lion.\n   Let's denote the number of Lion as L. Then the number of Bat is 2L.\n\n2. The number of Deer equals 2 times the number of Bat.\n   So, the number of Deer is 2 * 2L = 4L.\n\n3. The number of Lion equals 1 times the number of Horse.\n   Let's denote the number of Horse as H. Then the number of Lion is H.\n\n4. From step 2, we have the number of Deer as 4L, and from step 3, we have L = H.\n\n5. Substituting L = H in the expression for the number of Deer, we get the number of Deer as 4H.\n\n6. The number of Horse equals the product of the number of Wolf and the number of Moose.\n   Let's denote the number of Wolf as W and the number of Moose as M. Then H = WM.\n\n7. The number of Otter equals 1 times the number of Squirrel.\n   Let's denote the number of Squirrel as S. Then the number of Otter is S.\n\n8. The number of Fox equals 1 times the number of Bear.\n   Let's denote the number of Bear as B. Then the number of Fox is B.\n\n9. The number of Wolf equals 1 times the number of Fox.\n   So, the number of Wolf is B.\n\n10. From step 6, we have H = WM, and from step 9, we have W = B.\n\n11. Substituting W = B in the expression for H, we get H = BM.\n\n12. The number of Moose equals the product of the number of Raccoon and the number of Squirrel.\n   Let's denote the number of Raccoon as R. Then M = RS.\n\n13. The number of Raccoon equals 2 times the number of Otter.\n   So, the number of Raccoon is 2S.\n\n14. From step 12, we have M = RS, and from step 13, we have R = 2S.\n\n15. Substituting R = 2S in the expression for M, we get M = 2S^2.\n\n16. The number of Bear equals 1 times the product of the number of Moose, the number of Otter, and the number of Squirrel.\n   So, the number of Bear is M * S * S = 2S^3.\n\n17. From step 16, we have B = 2S^3.\n\n18. From step 11, we have H = BM, and from step 17, we have B = 2S^3.\n\n19. Substituting B = 2S^3 in the expression for H, we get H = 2S^3 * M.\n\n20. From step 15, we have M = 2S^2.\n\n21. Substituting M = 2S^2 in the expression for H, we get H = 2S^3 * 2S^2 = 4S^5.\n\n22. From step 4, we have the number of Deer as 4H.\n\n23. Substituting H = 4S^5 in the expression for the number of Deer, we get the number of Deer as 4 * 4S^5 = 16S^5.\n\n24. The number of Squirrel equals 1.\n   So, S = 1.\n\n25. Substituting S = 1 in the expression for the number of Deer, we get the number of Deer as 16 * 1^5 = 16.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$"

So, the number of Kangaroo is 4 * 2E = 8E.\n\n11. The number of Wolf equals the number of Lion.\n    The number of Lion is 2E. So, the number of Wolf is 2E.\n\n12. The number of Leopard equals 2 times the product of the number of Bat and the number of Fox.\n    The number of Bat is 2L and the number of Fox is 2.

The number of Raccoon equals the product of the number of Leopard and the number of Fox.\n    The number of Leopard is 8L and the number of Fox is 2. So, the number of Raccoon is 8L * 2 = 16L.\n\nNow we need to find the value of L. We know that the number of Lion equals the product of the number of Squirrel and the number of Bear. The number of Squirrel is 2E and the number of Bear is 1. So, the number of Lion is 2E * 1 = 2E.\n\nWe also know that the number of Bat equals 2 times the number of Lion. So, the number of Bat is 2 * 2E = 4E.\n\nWe are given that the number of Bat equals 2 times the number of Lion.
