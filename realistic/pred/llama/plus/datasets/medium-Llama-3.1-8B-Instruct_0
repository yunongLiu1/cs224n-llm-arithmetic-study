The number of Deer equals 267 plus the sum of the number of Wolf and the number of Bear.\n4.

We know the number of Parrot is 934, so the number of Eagle = 780 + 934 = 1714.\n\nNow we can substitute the value of the number of Eagle into the expression for the number of Crow: number of Crow = 429 + 1714 = 2143.\n\nNow we can substitute the values of the number of Crow, the number of Parrot, and the number of Eagle into the expression for the number of Blue Jay: number of Blue Jay = 322 + (2143 + 934 + 1714).\n\nFirst, let's add the numbers inside the parentheses: 2143 + 934 + 1714 = 4991.\n\nNow we can add 322 to that result: 322 + 4991 = 5313.\n\nTherefore, the number of Blue Jay is 5313."

            "To find the number of Parrot, we need to follow the given equations step by step.\n\n1. The number of Eagle equals 552 plus the number of Blue Jay.\n   Let's denote the number of Blue Jay as B. Then, the number of Eagle (E) is:\n   E = 552 + B\n   Since we know that B = 48, we can substitute this value:\n   E = 552 + 48\n   E = 600\n\n2. The number of Owl equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Blue Jay.\n   We already know that E = 600 and B = 48. So, the number of Owl (O) is:\n   O = E + B\n   O = 600 + 48\n   O = 648\n\n3. The number of Crow equals 903 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Eagle.\n   We know that O = 648 and E = 600. So, the number of Crow (C) is:\n   C = 903 + (O + E)\n   C = 903 + (648 + 600)\n   C = 903 + 1248\n   C = 2151\n\n4. The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Crow, the number of Eagle, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Owl.\n   We know that C = 2151, E = 600, B = 48, and O = 648. So, the number of Parrot (P) is:\n   P = C + E + B + O\n   P = 2151 + 600 + 48 + 648\n   P = 3447\n\nTherefore, the number of Parrot is 3447."

            "To find the number of Owl, we need to follow the given equations and solve for the number of Owl.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of Crow:\n\nNumber of Crow = 251 + (Number of Eagle + Number of Penguin)\n= 251 + (295 + (5 + Number of Penguin) + Number of Penguin)\n= 251 + (295 + 5 + 2*Number of Penguin)\n= 251 + 300 + 2*Number of Penguin\n= 551 + 2*Number of Penguin\n\nNow, let's find the number of Eagle:\n\nNumber of Eagle = 295 + (Number of Sparrow + Number of Penguin)\n= 295 + (5 + Number of Penguin + Number of Penguin)\n= 295 + 5 + 2*Number of Penguin\n= 300 + 2*Number of Penguin\n\nNow, let's find the number of Crow using the equation we derived earlier:\n\nNumber of Crow = 551 + 2*Number of Penguin\n\nWe know that the number of Crow equals the number of Eagle plus the number of Penguin. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n551 + 2*Number of Penguin = 300 + 2*Number of Penguin + Number of Penguin\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n551 = 300 + 3*Number of Penguin\n\nSubtracting 300 from both sides, we get:\n\n251 = 3*Number of Penguin\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nNumber of Penguin = 83.67 (approximately)\n\nHowever, the number of Penguin is given as 428, which is an integer. This means that our previous calculation was incorrect.\n\nLet's go back to the equation for the number of Crow:\n\nNumber of Crow = 251 + (Number of Eagle + Number of Penguin)\n= 251 + (295 + (5 + Number of Penguin) + Number of Penguin)\n= 251 + 300 + 2*Number of Penguin\n= 551 + 2*Number of Penguin\n\nWe know that the number of Crow equals the number of Eagle plus the number of Penguin. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n551 + 2*Number of Penguin = 300 + 2*Number of Penguin + Number of Penguin\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n551 = 300 + 3*Number of Penguin\n\nSubtracting 300 from both sides, we get:\n\n251 = 3*Number of Penguin\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nNumber of Penguin = 83.67 (approximately)\n\nHowever, we know that the number of Penguin is 428. This means that our previous calculation was incorrect.\n\nLet's try a different approach. We know that the number of Crow equals the number of Eagle plus the number of Penguin. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nNumber of Crow = Number of Eagle + Number of Penguin\n\nWe also know that the number of Crow equals 251 plus the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Penguin. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n251 + (Number of Eagle + Number of Penguin) = Number of Eagle + Number of Penguin\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n251 = 0\n\nThis is a contradiction, which means that our previous equations are inconsistent.\n\nHowever, we can try to find the number of Owl by using the equation:\n\nNumber of Owl = 647 + (Number of Crow + Number of Eagle)\n\nWe know that the number of Crow equals the number of Eagle plus the number of Penguin. So, we can substitute this expression into the equation:\n\nNumber of Owl = 647 + (Number of Eagle + Number of Penguin + Number of Eagle)\n= 647 + 2*Number of Eagle + Number of Penguin\n\nWe also know that the number of Eagle equals 295 plus the sum of the number of Sparrow and the number of Penguin. So, we can substitute this expression into the equation:\n\nNumber of Owl = 647 + (2*(295 + (5 + Number of Penguin) + Number of Penguin) + Number of Penguin)\n= 647 + 2*295 + 2*5 + 4*Number of Penguin\n= 647 + 590 + 10 + 4*Number of Penguin\n= 1247 + 4*Number of Penguin\n\nWe know that the number of Penguin is 428. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nNumber of Owl = 1247 + 4*428\n= 1247 + 1712\n= 2960\n\nTherefore, the number of Owl is 2960."

Number of Fox = 528 + (Number of Bear + Number of Wolf)\n3. Number of Deer = 455 + (Number of Raccoon + Number of Bear)\n4. Number of Elephant = 717 + Number of Wolf\n5. Number of Wolf = 396\n6. Number of Bear = 240 + Number of Elephant\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of Bear. We can do this by using equation 6 and substituting the value of Number of Elephant from equation 4.\n\nNumber of Bear = 240 + Number of Elephant\n= 240 + (717 + Number of Wolf)\n= 240 + 717 + 396\n= 1353\n\nNow that we have the number of Bear, we can find the number of Fox using equation 2.\n\nNumber of Fox = 528 + (Number of Bear + Number of Wolf)\n= 528 + (1353 + 396)\n= 528 + 1749\n= 2277\n\nNext, we can find the number of Raccoon using equation 1.\n\nNumber of Raccoon = 374 + (Number of Fox + Number of Bear)\n= 374 + (2277 + 1353)\n= 374 + 3630\n= 4004\n\nFinally, we can find the number of Deer using equation 3.\n\nNumber of Deer = 455 + (Number of Raccoon + Number of Bear)\n= 455 + (4004 + 1353)\n= 455 + 5357\n= 5812\n\nTherefore, the number of Deer is 5812."

We can substitute the values of Elephant, Wolf, and Tiger:\nNumber of Fox = 3960 + 791 + 791\nNumber of Fox = 5542\n\nFrom equation 3, we know the number of Horse equals 424 plus the number of Fox. We can substitute the value of Fox:\nNumber of Horse = 424 + 5542\nNumber of Horse = 5966\n\nFrom equation 7, we know the number of Raccoon equals 729 plus the number of Horse. We can substitute the value of Horse:\nNumber of Raccoon = 729 + 5966\nNumber of Raccoon = 6695\n\nFrom equation 6, we know the number of Lion equals the number of Raccoon. Therefore, the number of Lion is 6695."

            "To find the number of Peacock, we need to follow the given equations step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Find the number of Penguin\nThe number of Penguin equals 525 plus the number of Blue Jay. We are given that the number of Blue Jay equals 248. So, the number of Penguin equals 525 + 248 = 773.\n\n## Step 2: Find the number of Owl\nThe number of Owl equals 921 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Blue Jay. We already know the number of Penguin (773) and the number of Blue Jay (248). So, the number of Owl equals 921 + 773 + 248 = 1942.\n\n## Step 3: Find the number of Parrot\nThe number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Penguin. We already know the number of Owl (1942) and the number of Penguin (773). So, the number of Parrot equals 1942 + 773 = 2715.\n\n## Step 4: Find the number of Eagle\nThe number of Eagle equals the number of Parrot. We already know the number of Parrot (2715). So, the number of Eagle equals 2715.\n\n## Step 5: Find the number of Crow\nThe number of Crow equals 12 plus the number of Eagle. We already know the number of Eagle (2715). So, the number of Crow equals 12 + 2715 = 2727.\n\n## Step 6: Find the number of Sparrow\nThe number of Sparrow equals 936 plus the sum of the number of Crow and the number of Penguin. We already know the number of Crow (2727) and the number of Penguin (773). So, the number of Sparrow equals 936 + 2727 + 773 = 4436.\n\n## Step 7: Find the number of Peacock\nThe number of Peacock equals 77 plus the number of Sparrow. We already know the number of Sparrow (4436). So, the number of Peacock equals 77 + 4436 = 4513.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4513}$"

            "To find the number of Horse, we need to follow the given equations and solve for the number of Horse.\n\nLet's start by using the equation: The number of Lion equals 533.\n\nWe are also given that: The number of Tiger equals 639 plus the number of Elephant.\n\nWe can substitute the value of Lion into the equation for Elephant: The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Lion, and the number of Deer.\n\nThe number of Deer equals 590 plus the number of Lion. So, the number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Bear, 533, and 590 plus 533.\n\nThe number of Bear equals the number of Fox. The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Lion.\n\nThe number of Raccoon equals 3 plus the number of Wolf. The number of Wolf equals 557 plus the sum of the number of Deer and the number of Lion.\n\nSubstituting the value of Deer and Lion into the equation for Wolf, we get: The number of Wolf equals 557 plus (590 + 533).\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of Wolf into the equation for Raccoon: The number of Raccoon equals 3 plus (557 + 590 + 533).\n\nThe number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Lion. So, the number of Fox equals (3 + 557 + 590 + 533) + 533.\n\nThe number of Bear equals the number of Fox. So, the number of Bear equals (3 + 557 + 590 + 533) + 533.\n\nThe number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Lion, and the number of Deer. So, the number of Elephant equals ((3 + 557 + 590 + 533) + 533) + 533 + 590.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of Elephant into the equation for Tiger: The number of Tiger equals 639 plus the number of Elephant.\n\nThe number of Tiger equals 639 + ((3 + 557 + 590 + 533) + 533) + 533 + 590.\n\nThe number of Horse equals the sum of the number of Tiger and the number of Elephant. So, the number of Horse equals (639 + ((3 + 557 + 590 + 533) + 533) + 533 + 590) + ((3 + 557 + 590 + 533) + 533) + 533 + 590.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: The number of Horse equals 639 + 3 +

Then, the number of Eagle (E) is:\n   E = 251 + O\n\n2. The number of Parrot equals 856 plus the number of Eagle.\n   We already know that E = 251 + O.

So, the number of Blue Jay (B) is:\n   B = S + N + O\n   B = (2773 + 4O) + 382 + (758 + N)\n   B = 3913 + 4O + 382 + 758\n   B = 4053 + 4O\n\n6.

So, O is:\nO = 758 + 382\nO = 1140\n\nNow that we have the value of O, we can find the number of Hawk (H):\nH = 4053 + 4O\nH = 4053 + 4(1140)\nH = 4053 + 4560\nH = 8613\n\nThe final answer is 8613."

Number of Parrot = 980 + Number of Hawk\n\nWe can start by substituting equation (6) into equation (7):\n\nNumber of Parrot = 980 + Number of Hawk\n= 980 + (964 + Number of Penguin + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Owl)\n= 980 + 964 + Number of Penguin + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Owl\n\nNow, substitute equation (5) into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Parrot = 980 + 964 + (509 + Number of Owl) + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Owl\n= 980 + 964 + 509 + 2*Number of Owl + Number of Blue Jay\n\nSince Number of Owl = Number of Blue Jay (equation 4), we can substitute this into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Parrot = 980 + 964 + 509 + 2*Number of Blue Jay + Number of Blue Jay\n= 980 + 964 + 509 + 3*Number of Blue Jay\n\nNow, substitute equation (6) into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Parrot = 980 + 964 + 509 + 3*(952 + Number of Sparrow)\n= 980 + 964 + 509 + 3*952 + 3*Number of Sparrow\n\nSince Number of Sparrow = 157 (equation 2), we can substitute this into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Parrot = 980 + 964 + 509 + 3*952 + 3*157\n= 980 + 964 + 509 + 2856 + 471\n= 6080\n\nNow, substitute the value of Number of Parrot into equation (1):\n\nNumber of Eagle = Number of Parrot + Number of Owl + Number of Hawk\n= 6080 + Number of Owl + Number of Hawk\n\nSince Number of Owl = Number of Blue Jay (equation 4), we can substitute this into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Eagle = 6080 + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Hawk\n\nNow, substitute equation (3) into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Eagle = 6080 + Number of Blue Jay + (964 + Number of Penguin + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Owl)\n\nSince Number of Owl = Number of Blue Jay (equation 4), we can substitute this into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Eagle = 6080 + Number of Blue Jay + (964 + Number of Penguin + Number of Blue Jay + Number of Blue Jay)\n= 6080 + 2*Number of Blue Jay + 964 + Number of Penguin\n\nSince Number of Penguin = 509 + Number of Owl (equation 5), we can substitute this into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Eagle = 6080 + 2*Number of Blue Jay + 964 + (509 + Number of Owl)\n= 6080 + 2*Number of Blue Jay + 964 + 509 + Number of Owl\n\nSince Number of Owl = Number of Blue Jay (equation 4), we can substitute this into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Eagle = 6080 + 2*Number of Blue Jay + 964 + 509 + Number of Blue Jay\n= 6080 + 3*Number of Blue Jay + 1473\n\nNow, substitute equation (6) into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Eagle = 6080 + 3*(952 + Number of Sparrow) + 1473\n= 6080 + 3*952 + 3*Number of Sparrow + 1473\n\nSince Number of Sparrow = 157 (equation 2), we can substitute this into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Eagle = 6080 + 3*952 + 3*157 + 1473\n= 6080 + 2856 + 471 + 1473\n= 8380\n\nTherefore, the number of Eagle is 8380."

            "To find the number of Crow, we need to follow the given equations and solve for the number of Crow.\n\n1. The number of Owl equals 440.\n2. The number of Crow equals 911 plus the number of Blue Jay.\n3. The number of Eagle equals the number of Parrot.\n4. The number of Penguin equals 716 plus the number of Sparrow.\n5. The number of Sparrow equals 291 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Owl, and the number of Parrot.\n6. The number of Parrot equals 736 plus the number of Owl.\n7. The number of Blue Jay equals 140 plus the number of Hawk.\n8. The number of Hawk equals 184 plus the number of Penguin.\n\nLet's start by solving for the number of Parrot, Eagle, and Penguin, as they are related to each other.\n\nFrom equation 6, we know that the number of Parrot equals 736 plus the number of Owl. Since the number of Owl is 440, the number of Parrot is:\nParrot = 736 + 440 = 1176\n\nFrom equation 3, we know that the number of Eagle equals the number of Parrot, so the number of Eagle is also 1176.\n\nFrom equation 4, we know that the number of Penguin equals 716 plus the number of Sparrow. We don't know the number of Sparrow yet, but we can come back to this equation later.\n\nNow, let's solve for the number of Sparrow. From equation 5, we know that the number of Sparrow equals 291 plus the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Owl, and the number of Parrot. We already know the number of Eagle and Parrot, and the number of Owl is 440. So, the number of Sparrow is:\nSparrow = 291 + (1176 + 440 + 1176) = 291 + 3792 = 4083\n\nNow that we know the number of Sparrow, we can solve for the number of Penguin. From equation 4, we know that the number of Penguin equals 716 plus the number of Sparrow. So, the number of Penguin is:\nPenguin = 716 + 4083 = 4799\n\nFrom equation 8, we know that the number of Hawk equals 184 plus the number of Penguin. So, the number of Hawk is:\nHawk = 184 + 4799 = 4983\n\nFrom equation 7, we know that the number of Blue Jay equals 140 plus the number of Hawk. So, the number of Blue Jay is:\nBlue Jay = 140 + 4983 = 5123\n\nNow that we know the number of Blue Jay, we can solve for the number of Crow. From equation 2, we know that the number of Crow equals 911 plus the number of Blue Jay. So, the number of Crow is:\nCrow = 911 + 5123 = 6034\n\nTherefore, the number of Crow is 6034."

            "To find the number of Crow, we need to work backwards from the given information.\n\nWe are given that the number of Crow equals 31 plus the number of Parrot.\n\nWe are also given that the number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Cardinal, the number of Blue Jay, and the number of Eagle.\n\nSince the number of Blue Jay equals 343 and the number of Eagle equals 343 (because the number of Eagle equals the number of Blue Jay), we can substitute these values into the equation for the number of Parrot:\n\nNumber of Parrot = Number of Cardinal + 343 + 343\n= Number of Cardinal + 686\n\nNow, we are given that the number of Cardinal equals the number of Falcon.\n\nWe are also given that the number of Falcon equals 119 plus the sum of the number of Dove and the number of Eagle.\n\nSince the number of Eagle equals 343, we can substitute this value into the equation for the number of Falcon:\n\nNumber of Falcon = 119 + Number of Dove + 343\n= 119 + Number of Dove + 343\n\nWe are also given that the number of Dove equals 622 plus the number of Woodpecker.\n\nWe are given that the number of Woodpecker equals 225 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Blue Jay.\n\nSince the number of Blue Jay equals 343, we can substitute this value into the equation for the number of Woodpecker:\n\nNumber of Woodpecker = 225 + Number of Penguin + 343\n= 225 + Number of Penguin + 343\n\nWe are also given that the number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Eagle, and the number of Blue Jay.\n\nSince the number of Blue Jay equals 343 and the number of Eagle equals 343, we can substitute these values into the equation for the number of Penguin:\n\nNumber of Penguin = Number of Owl + 343 + 343\n= Number of Owl + 686\n\nWe are also given that the number of Owl equals the number of Eagle, which equals 343.\n\nSo, we can substitute this value into the equation for the number of Penguin:\n\nNumber of Penguin = 343 + 686\n= 1029\n\nNow, we can substitute this value into the equation for the number of Woodpecker:\n\nNumber of Woodpecker = 225 + 1029 + 343\n= 1597\n\nNow, we can substitute this value into the equation for the number of Dove:\n\nNumber of Dove = 622 + 1597\n= 2219\n\nNow, we can substitute this value into the equation for the number of Falcon:\n\nNumber of Falcon = 119 + 2219 + 343\n= 2581\n\nSince the number of Cardinal equals the number of Falcon, we can substitute this value into the equation for the number of Parrot:\n\nNumber of Parrot = 2581 + 686\n= 3267\n\nFinally, we can substitute this value into the equation for the number of Crow:\n\nNumber of Crow = 31 + 3267\n= 3298\n\nThe final answer is: 3298"

Since Number of Parrot = Number of Hawk, we can substitute this into the equation for Number of Sparrow:\n\nNumber of Sparrow = 267 + (Number of Blue Jay + Number of Hawk)\n= 267 + (824 + (Number of Hawk + Number of Hawk)) + Number of Hawk\n= 267 + 824 + 2*Number of Hawk + Number of Hawk\n= 1091 + 3*Number of Hawk\n\nNow, substitute the value of Number of Sparrow into the equation for Number of Peacock:\n\nNumber of Peacock = 774 + (1091 + 3*Number of Hawk)\n= 1865 + 3*Number of Hawk\n\nNow, substitute the value of Number of Peacock into the equation for Number of Penguin:\n\nNumber of Penguin = (2006 + 2*Number of Hawk) + Number of Hawk + (289 + (1865 + 3*Number of Hawk))\n= (2006 + 2*Number of Hawk) + Number of Hawk + 2154 + 3*Number of Hawk\n= 4150 + 6*Number of Hawk\n\nWe are given that Number of Hawk = 970, so we can substitute this into the equation for Number of Penguin:\n\nNumber of Penguin = 4150 + 6*970\n= 4150 + 5820\n= 9970\n\nTherefore, the number of Penguin is 9970."

The number of Bear equals the sum of the number of Elephant, the number of Fox, and the number of Lion. \n   The number of Elephant = 690, the number of Fox = 39, and the number of Lion = 379. \n   So, the number of Bear = 690 + 39 + 379 = 1108.\n\n4. The number of Deer equals 293 plus the number of Wolf. \n   The number of Wolf equals 811 plus the number of Raccoon. \n   We will come back to this later.\n\n5. The number of Horse equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Fox, and the number of Lion. \n   The number of Bear = 1108, the number of Fox = 39, and the number of Lion = 379. \n   So, the number of Horse = 1108 + 39 + 379 = 1526.\n\n6. The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Horse, the number of Elephant, and the number of Lion. \n   The number of Horse = 1526, the number of Elephant = 690, and the number of Lion = 379. \n   So, the number of Raccoon = 1526 + 690 + 379 = 2595.\n\n7. The number of Wolf equals 811 plus the number of Raccoon. \n   The number of Raccoon = 2595. \n   So, the number of Wolf = 811 + 2595 = 3406.\n\n8. The number of Deer equals 293 plus the number of Wolf. \n   The number of Wolf = 3406. \n   So, the number of Deer = 293 + 3406 = 3699.\n\n9. The number of Tiger equals 21 plus the number of Deer. \n   The number of Deer = 3699. \n   So, the number of Tiger = 21 + 3699 = 3720.\n\nThe final answer is: 3720"

            "To find the number of Fox, we need to follow the given equations step by step.\n\n1. The number of Deer equals 580.\n2. The number of Tiger equals 681 plus the number of Deer.\n   So, the number of Tiger = 681 + 580 = 1261.\n3. The number of Horse equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Tiger, and the number of Deer.\n   We don't know the number of Wolf yet, so we'll come back to this equation later.\n4. The number of Bear equals 285 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Deer, and the number of Horse.\n   We don't know the number of Raccoon yet, so we'll come back to this equation later.\n5. The number of Elephant equals 192 plus the number of Tiger.\n   So, the number of Elephant = 192 + 1261 = 1453.\n6. The number of Raccoon equals 415 plus the sum of the number of Horse and the number of Elephant.\n   We don't know the number of Horse yet, so we'll come back to this equation later.\n7. The number of Wolf equals 498 plus the number of Elephant.\n   So, the number of Wolf = 498 + 1453 = 1951.\n8. Now we can find the number of Horse using the equation from step 3.\n   The number of Horse = the number of Wolf + the number of Tiger + the number of Deer.\n   So, the number of Horse = 1951 + 1261 + 580 = 3792.\n9. Now we can find the number of Raccoon using the equation from step 4.\n   The number of Bear = 285 + the number of Raccoon + the number of Deer + the number of Horse.\n   We know the number of Bear, Deer, and Horse, so we can rearrange the equation to find the number of Raccoon.\n   The number of Raccoon = the number of Bear - 285 - the number of Deer - the number of Horse.\n   So, the number of Raccoon = 285 + the number of Bear - 285 - 580 - 3792.\n   We know the number of Bear equals 128 plus the number of Lion, and we don't know the number of Lion yet, so we'll come back to this equation later.\n10. The number of Lion equals 128 plus the number of Bear.\n    We don't know the number of Bear yet, so we'll come back to this equation later.\n11. The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Bear.\n    We don't know the number of Lion or Bear yet, so we'll come back to this equation later.\n\nNow we have a loop. We need to find the number of Bear to find the number of Lion, and we need the number of Lion to find the number of Fox. We also need the number of Raccoon to find the number of Bear.\n\nLet's go back to the equation for the number of Bear (step 4) and rearrange it to find the number of Raccoon in terms of the number of Bear.\nThe number of Raccoon = the number of Bear - 285 - the number of Deer - the number of Horse.\nWe know the number of Deer and Horse, so we can substitute those values in.\nThe number of Raccoon = the number of Bear - 285 - 580 - 3792.\nThe number of Raccoon = the number of Bear - 5457.\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for the number of Raccoon into the equation for the number of Bear (step 4).\nThe number of Bear = 285 + the number of Raccoon + the number of Deer + the number of Horse.\nThe number of Bear = 285 + (the number of Bear - 5457) + 580 + 3792.\nThe number of Bear = the number of Bear - 5457 + 285 + 580 + 3792.\nThe number of Bear - the number of Bear = -5457 + 285 + 580 + 3792.\n0 = -4680.\n\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no solution to the problem."

Since the number of Hawk equals the number of Peacock (equation 4), and the number of Peacock equals the number of Dove (equation 3), we can substitute this value into equation 2:\n\nNumber of Falcon = 657 + Number of Dove\n\nSince the number of Dove is 951, we can substitute this value into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Falcon = 657 + 951\nNumber of Falcon = 1608\n\nNow that we know the number of Falcon, we can find the number of Cardinal:\n\nNumber of Cardinal = 692 + Number of Falcon\n= 692 + 1608\n= 2300\n\nNow that we know the number of Cardinal, we can find the number of Blue Jay:\n\nNumber of Blue Jay = 728 + Number of Cardinal\n= 728 + 2300\n= 3028\n\nNow that we know the number of Blue Jay, we can find the number of Eagle:\n\nNumber of Eagle = Number of Blue Jay + 951 + Number of Parrot\n= 3028 + 951 + Number of Parrot\n\nSince the number of Parrot equals the number of Falcon, we can substitute this value into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Eagle = 3028 + 951 + 1608\n= 4587\n\nNow that we know the number of Eagle, we can find the number of Sparrow:\n\nNumber of Sparrow = Number of Eagle\n= 4587\n\nNow that we know the number of Sparrow, we can find the number of Penguin:\n\nNumber of Penguin = Number of Sparrow + Number of Crow + Number of Falcon\n= 4587 + Number of Crow + 1608\n\nSince the number of Crow equals the number of Cardinal, we can substitute this value into the above equation:\n\nNumber of Penguin = 4587 + 2300 + 1608\n= 8495\n\nTherefore, the number of Penguin is 8495."

            "To find the number of Penguin, we need to follow the given equations and substitute the values step by step.\n\n1. The number of Crow equals 952.\n2. The number of Falcon equals the number of Crow, so the number of Falcon equals 952.\n3. The number of Sparrow equals 882 plus the number of Crow, so the number of Sparrow equals 882 + 952 = 1834.\n4. The number of Owl equals 50 plus the number of Sparrow, so the number of Owl equals 50 + 1834 = 1884.\n5. The number of Cardinal equals the number of Falcon, so the number of Cardinal equals 952.\n6. The number of Peacock equals 592 plus the number of Cardinal, so the number of Peacock equals 592 + 952 = 1544.\n7. The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Peacock, so the number of Blue Jay equals 1544.\n8. The number of Crow equals 952, so the number of Crow is already known.\n9. The number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Crow, and the number of Owl, but we don't know the number of Eagle yet. We'll come back to this equation later.\n10. The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Blue Jay and the number of Crow, so the number of Parrot equals 1544 + 952 = 2496.\n11. The number of Eagle equals 930 plus the sum of the number of Owl and the number of Sparrow, so the number of Eagle equals 930 + 1884 + 1834 = 4648.\n12. Now we can find the number of Hawk: the number of Hawk equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Crow, and the number of Owl, so the number of Hawk equals 4648 + 952 + 1884 = 6784.\n13. The number of Falcon equals the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Sparrow, so the number of Falcon equals 6784 + 1834 = 8618, but we already know the number of Falcon equals 952, so this equation is inconsistent.\n14. However, we can ignore this inconsistency and continue with the problem. The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Eagle, and the number of Cardinal, so the number of Penguin equals 2496 + 4648 + 952 = 8196.\n\nThe final answer is: 8196"

The number of Bear equals 820 plus the number of Tiger.\n   Let's denote the number of Bear as B, the number of Tiger as T. \n   B = 820 + T\n   Since T = 220, \n   B = 820 + 220 = 1040\n\n2.

The number of Fox equals 332 plus the number of Wolf.\n   Let's denote the number of Fox as F. \n   F = 332 + W\n   Since W = 688 + E + D, \n   F = 332 + 688 + E + D\n   F = 1020 + E + D\n\n4. The number of Lion equals the number of Fox.\n   Let's denote the number of Lion as L. \n   L = F\n   Since F = 1020 + E + D, \n   L = 1020 + E + D\n\n5. The number of Raccoon equals 138 plus the sum of the number of Lion, the number of Wolf, and the number of Fox.\n   Let's denote the number of Raccoon as R. \n   R = 138 + L + W + F\n   Since L = 1020 + E + D, W = 688 + E + D, F = 1020 + E + D, \n   R = 138 + (1020 + E + D) + (688 + E + D) + (1020 + E + D)\n   R = 138 + 2728 + 3E + 3D\n   R = 2866 + 3E + 3D\n\n6.

            "To find the number of Kangaroo, we need to follow the given equations and solve for the number of Kangaroo.\n\nFrom the equation \"The number of Rabbit equals the number of Fox\", we know that the number of Rabbit is equal to the number of Fox.\n\nFrom the equation \"The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Raccoon, the number of Bat, the number of Wolf, and the number of Tiger\", we can substitute the given values:\n\nNumber of Fox = Number of Raccoon + Number of Bat + Number of Wolf + Number of Tiger\n= 127 + 951 + 521 + 951\n= 2550\n\nSince the number of Rabbit is equal to the number of Fox, we can say that the number of Rabbit is also 2550.\n\nFrom the equation \"The number of Kangaroo equals the sum of the number of Bear, the number of Leopard, and the number

            "To find the number of Hawk, we need to follow the given equations and solve for the number of Hawk.\n\nFrom the given equations, we know that:\n\n1. The number of Cardinal equals 297 plus the number of Falcon.\n2. The number of Crow equals 799.\n3. The number of Hawk equals the number of Woodpecker.\n4. The number of Peacock equals the number of Owl.\n5. The number of Eagle equals 875 plus the number of Crow.\n6. The number of Parrot equals the number of Sparrow.\n7. The number of Falcon equals the number of Blue Jay.\n8. The number of Owl equals 391.\n9. The number of Woodpecker equals 762 plus the number of Dove.\n10. The number of Dove equals 953 plus the sum of the number of Cardinal, the number of Crow, and the number of Falcon.\n11. The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Penguin, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Eagle.\n12. The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Crow.\n13. The number of Penguin equals the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Eagle.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of Dove:\n\nFrom equation 10, we know that the number of Dove equals 953 plus the sum of the number of Cardinal, the number of Crow, and the number of Falcon.\n\nWe know that the number of Cardinal equals 297 plus the number of Falcon (equation 1), and the number of Crow equals 799 (equation 2). We also know that the number of Falcon equals the number of Blue Jay (equation 7).\n\nLet's substitute these values into equation 10:\n\nNumber of Dove = 953 + (297 + number of Falcon) + 799 + number of Falcon\n\nSince the number of Falcon equals the number of Blue Jay, we can substitute this value as well:\n\nNumber of Dove = 953 + (297 + number of Blue Jay) + 799 + number of Blue Jay\n\nNow, we know that the number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Penguin, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Eagle (equation 11). We also know that the number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Crow (equation 12).\n\nLet's substitute these values into the equation:\n\nNumber of Dove = 953 + (297 +

Parrot and the number of Eagle (equation 13), and the number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Eagle and the number of Crow (equation 12).\n\nLet's substitute these values into the

Eagle)) + 799 + ((1674 + 1674 + number of Eagle) + number of Eagle + number of Eagle)\n\nNow, we know that the number of Eagle equals 875 plus the number of Crow (equation 5), and the number of Crow equals 799 (equation 2).\n\nLet's substitute these values into the equation:\n\nNumber of Dove = 953 + (297 + ((1674 + 1674 + 875 + 799) + (875 + 799 + number of Eagle) + number of Eagle)) + 799 + ((1674 + 1674 + 875 + 799) + (875 + 799 + number of Eagle) + number of Eagle)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\nNumber of Dove = 953 + (297 + (4271 + (1754 + number of Eagle) + number of

Since Rc = F, we can substitute F for Rc.\nD = Lo + F + F\nD = Lo + 2F\n\nFrom equation 13, we know Lo = 124 + Rc. Since Rc = F, we can substitute F for Rc.\nLo = 124 + F\n\nNow, substitute Lo in the equation for D:\nD = (124 + F) + 2F\nD = 124 + 3F\n\nFrom equation 10, we know F = 165.\nD = 124 + 3(165)\nD = 124 + 495\nD = 619\n\nFrom equation 6, we know L = 967 + D.

Parrot = 350 + Blue Jay\n3. Eagle = 252 + Blue Jay\n4. Cardinal = 901\n5. Blue Jay = 76 + Woodpecker\n6. Sparrow = 642 + Eagle\n7. Pigeon = 471 + (Dove + Vulture + Eagle + Sparrow + Peacock)\n8. Woodpecker = 928 + (Swan + Cardinal)\n9. Vulture = 989 + Owl\n10. Dove = 500 + Eagle\n11. Penguin = Sparrow\n12. Hawk = Crow + Parrot + Owl\n13. Crow = Vulture + Cardinal + Woodpecker\n14. Peacock = 536 + Eagle\n15. Swan = 796 + (Falcon + Cardinal)\n16. Falcon = 892 + Cardinal\n\nWe can start by solving for the number of Blue Jay:\n\nBlue Jay = 76 + Woodpecker\nWoodpecker = 928 + (Swan + Cardinal)\nSwan = 796 + (Falcon + Cardinal)\nFalcon = 892 + Cardinal\nCardinal = 901\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\nWoodpecker = 928 + (796 + 892 + 901)\nWoodpecker = 3517\nBlue Jay = 76 + 3517\nBlue Jay = 3593\n\nNow, we can find the number of Parrot:\nParrot = 350 + Blue Jay\nParrot = 350 + 3593\nParrot = 3943\n\nSince Owl = Parrot, we have:\nOwl = 3943\n\nNow, we can find the number of Eagle:\nEagle = 252 + Blue Jay\nEagle = 252 + 3593\nEagle = 3845\n\nNow, we can find the number of Sparrow:\nSparrow = 642 + Eagle\nSparrow = 642 + 3845\nSparrow = 4487\n\nSince Penguin = Sparrow, we have:\nPenguin = 4487\n\nNow, we can find the number of Dove:\nDove = 500 + Eagle\nDove = 500 + 3845\nDove = 4345\n\nNow, we can find the number of Vulture:\nVulture = 989 + Owl\nVulture = 989 + 3943\nVulture = 4932\n\nNow, we can find the number of Crow:\nCrow = Vulture + Cardinal + Woodpecker\nCrow = 4932 + 901 + 3517\nCrow = 8740\n\nNow, we can find the number of Peacock:\nPeacock = 536 + Eagle\nPeacock = 536 + 3845\nPeacock = 4381\n\nNow, we can find the number of Swan:\nSwan = 796 + (Falcon + Cardinal)\nSwan = 796 + (892 + 901)\nSwan = 2589\n\nNow, we can find the number of Falcon:\nFalcon = 892 + Cardinal\nFalcon = 892 + 901\nFalcon = 1793\n\nNow, we can find the number of Pigeon:\nPigeon = 471 + (Dove + Vulture + Eagle + Sparrow + Peacock)\nPigeon = 471 + (4345 + 4932 + 3845 + 4487 + 4381)\nPigeon = 28101\n\nNow, we can find the number of Hawk:\nHawk = Crow + Parrot + Owl\nHawk = 8740 + 3943 + 3943\nHawk = 16626\n\nTherefore, the number of Hawk is 16626."

            "## Step 1: Identify the equations given in the problem\nWe have several equations based on the problem statement:\n1. Horse = 26 + Bear + Raccoon\n2. Moose = Elephant + Kangaroo\n3. Leopard = 897 + Tiger\n4. Bear = 548 + Raccoon + Elephant\n5. Squirrel = Leopard + Raccoon\n6. Wolf = 148\n7. Deer = Horse\n8. Elephant = 576 + Kangaroo\n9. Lion = 869 + Wolf\n10.

Raccoon = Fox + Moose\n\n## Step 2: Simplify the equations by substituting known values\nFrom equation 6, we know Wolf = 148. We can use this to find Lion from equation 9: Lion = 869 + 148 = 1017.\n\n## Step 3: Continue simplifying the equations\nFrom equation 11, we can find Kangaroo: Kangaroo = 766 + 1017 + 148 = 1931.\n\n## Step 4: Use the value of Kangaroo to find Elephant\nFrom equation 8, we can find Elephant: Elephant = 576 + 1931 = 2507.\n\n## Step 5: Find the value of Bear\nFrom equation 4, we can find Bear: Bear = 548 + Raccoon + 2507. However, we still need to find Raccoon.\n\n## Step 6: Find the value of Raccoon\nFrom equation 14, we can find Raccoon: Raccoon = Fox + Moose. We still need to find Fox and Moose.\n\n## Step 7: Find the value of Fox\nFrom equation 12, we can find Fox: Fox = 388 + Moose + 1931. We still need to find Moose.\n\n## Step 8: Find the value of Moose\nFrom equation 2, we can find Moose: Moose = Elephant + Kangaroo = 2507 + 1931 = 4438.\n\n## Step 9: Now that we have Moose, we can find Fox\nFrom equation 12, we can find Fox: Fox = 388 + 4438 + 1931 = 7857.\n\n## Step 10: Now that we have Fox and Moose, we can find Raccoon\nFrom equation 14, we can find Raccoon: Raccoon = 7857 + 4438 = 12295.\n\n## Step 11: Now that we have Raccoon, we can find Bear\nFrom equation 4, we can find Bear: Bear = 548 + 12295 = 12743.\n\n## Step 12: Find the value of Tiger\nFrom equation 10, we can find Tiger: Tiger = 59 + 12743 = 12742.\n\n## Step 13: Find the value of Leopard\nFrom equation 3, we can find Leopard: Leopard = 897 + 12742 = 13639.\n\n## Step 14: Find the value of Squirrel\nFrom equation 5, we can find Squirrel: Squirrel = Leopard + Raccoon = 13639 + 12295 = 25934.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25934}$"

We can substitute the value of the number of Fox into this equation:\n\nNumber of Kangaroo = Number of Fox\n\nFrom equation 12, we know that the number of Fox equals the number of Wolf. We can substitute the value of the number of Wolf into this equation:\n\nNumber of Fox = Number of Wolf\n\nFrom equation 3, we know that the number of Wolf equals 350 plus the sum of the number of Raccoon and the number of Lion. We can substitute the values of the number of Raccoon and the number of Lion into this equation:\n\nNumber of Wolf = 350 + Number of Raccoon + Number of Lion\n= 350 + 1035 + 544\n= 1929\n\nNow we can substitute the value of the number of Wolf into the equation for the number of Fox:\n\nNumber of Fox = Number of Wolf\n= 1929\n\nNow we can substitute the value of the number of Fox into the equation for the number of Kangaroo:\n\nNumber of Kangaroo = Number of Fox\n= 1929\n\nNow we can substitute the value of the number of Kangaroo into the equation for the number of Rabbit:\n\nNumber of Rabbit = 453 + Number of Kangaroo\n= 453 + 1929\n= 2382\n\nNow we can substitute the value of the number of Rabbit into the equation for the number of Horse:\n\nNumber of Horse = Number of Rabbit + 1579\n= 2382 + 1579\n= 3961\n\nNow we can substitute the value of the number of Horse into the equation for the number of Leopard:\n\nNumber of Leopard = 406 + Number of Horse\n= 406 + 3961\n= 4367\n\nNow we can substitute the value of the number of Leopard into the equation for the number of Elephant:\n\nNumber of Elephant = 180 + Number of Leopard\n= 180 + 4367\n= 4547\n\nNow we can substitute the value of the number of Elephant into the equation for the number of Moose:\n\nNumber of Moose = Number of Elephant\n= 4547\n\nNow we can substitute the value of the number of Moose into the equation for the number of Squirrel:\n\nNumber of Squirrel = Number of Moose\n= 4547\n\nTherefore, the number of Squirrel is 4547."

The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Parrot, the number of Owl, the number of Sparrow, and the number of Eagle.\n   C = P + O + S + E\n\n3.

E = 301\n6. S = 1057\n7. PC = B + H + P\n8. PN = 467 + F\n9. H = 882 + C\n10. F = PC\n\nFrom equation 6, we know S = 1057.

Substituting O = 1057, we get P = 878 + 1057 = 1935.\n\nFrom equation 5, we know E = 301.\n\nFrom equation 2, we know C = P + O + S + E. Substituting P = 1935, O = 1057, S = 1057, and E = 301, we get C = 1935 + 1057 + 1057 + 301 = 4350.\n\nFrom equation 9, we know H = 882 + C.

The number of Cardinal equals 660 plus the sum of the number of Falcon, the number of Dove, and the number of Owl.\n   C = 660 + F + D + O\n   Since the number of Dove equals the number of Owl, we can substitute D with O.\n   C = 660 + F + O + O\n   C = 660 + F + 2O\n\n3.

Substitute the values of W and C in the equation for P.\n   P = W + F + E + 1982\n   P = (2132 + F) + F + E + 1982\n   P = 4114 + 2F + E\n\n9.

            "To find the number of Raccoon, we need to follow the given equations and find the values of the variables.\n\nFrom the equation \"The number of Raccoon equals the sum of the number of Wolf, the number of Leopard, and the number of Fox\", we can start by finding the values of Wolf, Leopard, and Fox.\n\nWe are given that \"The number of Rabbit equals 918\" and \"The number of Bear equals 530 plus the number of Rabbit\". So, we can find the number of Bear by substituting the value of Rabbit:\n\nBear = 530 + 918\nBear = 1448\n\nWe are also given that \"The number of Bat equals 586\" and \"The number of Coyote equals 983\". We can use these values to find the number of Wolf:\n\nThe number of Wolf equals 886 plus the sum of the number of Moose and the number of Lion.\nWe are given that \"The number of Moose equals 876 plus the number of Tiger\" and \"The number of Tiger equals the number of Fox\". So, we can find the number of Moose and Tiger by substituting the value of Fox:\n\nFox =? (we will find it later)\nTiger = Fox\nMoose = 876 + Fox\n\nWe are also given that \"The number of Lion equals 316 plus the sum of the number of Leopard and the number of Elephant\". We can find the number of Lion by substituting the values of Leopard and Elephant:\n\nLeopard =? (we will find it later)\nElephant = 313 + 275 (given)\nElephant = 588\nLion = 316 + (Leopard + Elephant)\nLion = 316 + (Leopard + 588)\n\nNow, we can find the number of Wolf by substituting the values of Moose and Lion:\n\nWolf = 886 + (Moose + Lion)\nWolf = 886 + (876 + Fox + 316 + (Leopard + 588))\n\nWe are given that \"The number of Squirrel equals the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Horse\". We can find the number of Squirrel by substituting the values of Lion and Horse:\n\nHorse = 809 + 313 (given)\nHorse = 1122\nSquirrel = Lion + Horse\nSquirrel = (316 + (Leopard + 588)) + 1122\n\nWe are also given that \"The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Squirrel and the number of Leopard\". We can find the number of Fox by substituting the values of Squirrel and Leopard:\n\nFox = Squirrel + Leopard\nFox = ((316 + (Leopard + 588)) + 1122) + Leopard\n\nNow, we can find the value of Fox by substituting the value of Leopard:\n\nLeopard = 843 + Horse (given)\nLeopard = 843 + 1122\nLeopard = 1965\nFox = ((316 + (1965 + 588)) + 1122) + 1965\nFox = 316 + 1965 + 588 + 1122 + 1965\nFox = 5156\n\nNow that we have the value of Fox, we can find the value of Tiger:\n\nTiger = Fox\nTiger = 5156\n\nNow that we have the value of Tiger, we can find the value of Moose:\n\nMoose = 876 + Fox\nMoose = 876 + 5156\nMoose = 6032\n\nNow that we have the value of Moose, we can find the value of Wolf:\n\nWolf = 886 + (Moose + Lion)\nWolf = 886 + (6032 + (316 + (1965 + 588)))\nWolf = 886 + (6032 + 316 + 2553)\nWolf = 886 + 8691\nWolf = 9577\n\nNow that we have the value of Wolf, we can find the value of Raccoon:\n\nRaccoon = Wolf + Leopard + Fox\nRaccoon = 9577 + 1965 + 5156\nRaccoon = 16698\n\nTherefore, the number of Raccoon is 16698."

The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Fox and the number of Bear.\n   Since the number of Bear is 224, we need to find the number of Fox first.\n   The number of Fox equals the sum of the number of Kangaroo and the number of Bear.\n   The number of Kangaroo equals 98 plus the number of Bear.\n   So, the number of Kangaroo equals 98 + 224 = 322.\n   The number of Fox equals 322 + 224 = 546.\n   Now, the number of Wolf equals 546 + 224 = 770.\n3. The number of Tiger equals 316 plus the number of Wolf.\n   So, the number of Tiger equals 316 + 770 = 1086.\n4. The number of Raccoon equals 732 plus the sum of the number of Tiger, the number of Fox, and the number of Bear.\n   So, the number of Raccoon equals 732 + 1086 + 224 = 2042.\n5. The number of Moose equals 30 plus the number of Raccoon.\n   So, the number of Moose equals 30 + 2042 = 2072.\n6. The number of Horse equals 786 plus the number of Moose.\n   So, the number of Horse equals 786 + 2072 = 2858.\n7. The number of Deer equals 762 plus the number of Horse.\n   So, the number of Deer equals 762 + 2858 = 3620.\n8. The number of Lion equals 56 plus the number of Deer.\n   So, the number of Lion equals 56 + 3620 = 3676.\n9. The number of Elephant equals the sum of the number of Lion and the number of Wolf.\n   So, the number of Elephant equals 3676 + 770 = 4446.\n\nThe final answer is: 4446"

            "To find the number of Crow, we need to follow the given equations and solve for the number of Crow.\n\nFrom the given equations, we can start by finding the number of Eagle, which is already given as 174.\n\nNext, we can find the number of Owl by substituting the number of Sparrow, which is equal to the sum of the number of Dove and the number of Eagle.\n\nThe number of Dove is 286 plus the sum of the number of Cardinal and the number of Blue Jay. The number of Cardinal is equal to the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Peacock. The number of Blue Jay is equal to the sum of the number of Peacock and the number of Woodpecker.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of Peacock. The number of Peacock is equal to the number of Woodpecker, which is 801 plus the number of Falcon. The number of Falcon is 862 plus the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Eagle.\n\nThe number of Penguin is 153 plus the number of Eagle, which is 174. So, the number of Penguin is 327.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Falcon: 862 + (327 + 174) = 1363.\n\nThe number of Woodpecker is 801 + 1363 = 2164.\n\nThe number of Peacock is also 2164.\n\nThe number of Blue Jay is 2164 + 2164 = 4328.\n\nThe number of Cardinal is 4328 + 4328 = 8656.\n\nThe number of Dove is 286 + (8656 + 4328) = 13970.\n\nThe number of Sparrow is 13970 + 174 = 14144.\n\nThe number of Owl is 520 + 14144 = 14664.\n\nThe number of Crow is 796 + 14664 = 15460.\n\nThe final answer is: 15460"

            "To find the number of Deer, we need to follow the given equations step by step.\n\n1. The number of Moose equals 994.\n2. The number of Wolf equals the sum of the number of Fox, the number of Kangaroo, and the number of Raccoon.\n   Since the number of Kangaroo equals the number of Moose, we can substitute the value of Moose into the equation for Wolf:\n   Wolf = Fox + Moose + Raccoon\n   Wolf = Fox + 994 + Raccoon\n3. The number of Fox equals 121 plus the number of Raccoon.\n   Fox = 121 + Raccoon\n   Substitute this value of Fox into the equation for Wolf:\n   Wolf = (121 + Raccoon) + 994 + Raccoon\n   Wolf = 121 + 2Raccoon + 994\n   Wolf = 1115 + 2Raccoon\n4. The number of Raccoon equals 755 plus the number of Bear.\n   Raccoon = 755 + Bear\n   Substitute this value of Raccoon into the equation for Wolf:\n   Wolf = 1115 + 2(755 + Bear)\n   Wolf = 1115 + 1510 + 2Bear\n   Wolf = 2625 + 2Bear\n5. The number of Tiger equals 596 plus the number of Wolf.\n   Tiger = 596 + Wolf\n   Substitute the value of Wolf from the previous equation:\n   Tiger = 596 + (2625 + 2Bear)\n   Tiger = 3221 + 2Bear\n6. The number of Horse equals 693 plus the number of Tiger.\n   Horse = 693 + Tiger\n   Substitute the value of Tiger from the previous equation:\n   Horse = 693 + (3221 + 2Bear)\n   Horse = 3914 + 2Bear\n7. The number of Bear equals 527 plus the sum of the number of Kangaroo and the number of Moose.\n   Bear = 527 + Kangaroo + Moose\n   Since the number of Kangaroo equals the number of Moose, we can substitute the value of Moose into the equation for Bear:\n   Bear = 527 + Moose + Moose\n   Bear = 527 + 2Moose\n   Substitute the value of Moose:\n   Bear = 527 + 2(994)\n   Bear = 527 + 1988\n   Bear = 2515\n8. The number of Elephant equals 394 plus the number of Horse.\n   Elephant = 394 + Horse\n   Substitute the value of Horse from the previous equation:\n   Elephant = 394 + (3914 + 2Bear)\n   Elephant = 394 + 3914 + 2(2515)\n   Elephant = 4308 + 5030\n   Elephant = 9338\n9. The number of Lion equals the sum of the number of Elephant and the number of Moose.\n   Lion = Elephant + Moose\n   Substitute the values of Elephant and Moose:\n   Lion = 9338 + 994\n   Lion = 10332\n10.

            "To find the number of Fox, we need to follow the given equations and solve for the number of Fox.\n\nFrom the given equations, we have:\n\n1. Number of Fox = 68 + Number of Rabbit\n2. Number of Bear = Number of Horse + Number of Lion + Number of Elephant\n3. Number of Kangaroo = 503 + Number of Bat + Number of Horse\n4. Number of Lion = 981\n5. Number of Bat = Number of Squirrel + Number of Bear\n6. Number of Squirrel = Number of Moose\n7. Number of Raccoon = 464\n8. Number of Deer = 378 + Number of Kangaroo\n9. Number of Leopard = Number of Bear + Number of Elephant + Number of Moose + Number of Bat\n10. Number of Moose = 82 + Number of Bear + Number of Lion\n11. Number of Elephant = 208 + Number of Lion\n12. Number of Tiger = 872 + Number of Moose\n13. Number of Otter = 374 + Number of Moose + Number of Elephant\n14. Number of Wolf = Number of Rabbit + Number of Raccoon\n15. Number of Horse = 395 + Number of Elephant\n16. Number of Rabbit = 65 + Number of Deer\n\nWe can start by solving for the number of Moose, which is given by equation 10:\n\nNumber of Moose = 82 + Number of Bear + Number of Lion\n= 82 + (395 + Number of Elephant) + 981\n= 82 + 395 + 981 + Number of Elephant\n= 1458 + Number of Elephant\n\nNow, substitute the expression for Number of Moose into equation 11:\n\nNumber of Elephant = 208 + Number of Lion\n= 208 + 981\n= 1189\n\nNow, substitute the value of Number of Elephant into the expression for Number of Moose:\n\nNumber of Moose = 1458 + 1189\n= 2647\n\nNow, substitute the value of Number of Moose into equation 10:\n\nNumber of Moose = 82 + Number of Bear + Number of Lion\n2647 = 82 + Number of Bear + 981\n2647 = 1063 + Number of Bear\nNumber of Bear = 2647 - 1063\nNumber of Bear = 1584\n\nNow, substitute the value of Number of Bear into equation 5:\n\nNumber of Bat = Number of Squirrel + Number of Bear\n= Number of Moose + Number of Bear\n= 2647 + 1584\n= 4231\n\nNow, substitute the value of Number of Bat into equation 3:\n\nNumber of Kangaroo = 503 + Number of Bat + Number of Horse\n= 503 + 4231 + (395 + Number of Elephant)\n= 503 + 4231 + 395 + 1189\n= 6118\n\nNow, substitute the value of Number of Kangaroo into equation 8:\n\nNumber of Deer = 378 + Number of Kangaroo\n= 378 + 6118\n= 6496\n\nNow, substitute the value of Number of Deer into equation 16:\n\nNumber of Rabbit = 65 + Number of Deer\n= 65 + 6496\n= 6561\n\nNow, substitute the value of Number of Rabbit into equation 1:\n\nNumber of Fox = 68 + Number of Rabbit\n= 68 + 6561\n= 6629\n\nTherefore, the number of Fox is 6629."

            "To find the number of Fox, we need to follow the given equations and solve for the number of Fox.\n\nGiven equations:\n\n1. Wolf = 212 + Moose\n2. Lion = 831 + Elephant\n3. Deer = 294 + Raccoon + Tiger\n4. Elephant = 613\n5. Bear = Tiger + Lion + Wolf\n6. Tiger = Horse\n7. Moose = 774 + Lion + Elephant\n8. Raccoon = 259 + Bear\n9. Kangaroo = 20 + Deer\n10. Fox = Kangaroo\n11. Horse = 773 + Wolf\n\nFirst, let's find the number of Tiger, which is equal to the number of Horse.\n\nHorse = 773 + Wolf\nSince Wolf = 212 + Moose, we can substitute this into the equation:\nHorse = 773 + (212 + Moose)\nHorse = 985 + Moose\n\nNow, we know that Tiger = Horse, so:\nTiger = 985 + Moose\n\nNext, let's find the number of Moose.\n\nMoose = 774 + Lion + Elephant\nWe know that Elephant = 613, so:\nMoose = 774 + Lion + 613\nMoose = 1387 + Lion\n\nNow, substitute the expression for Moose into the equation for Tiger:\nTiger = 985 + (1387 + Lion)\nTiger = 2372 + Lion\n\nNow, let's find the number of Lion.\n\nLion = 831 + Elephant\nWe know that Elephant = 613, so:\nLion = 831 + 613\nLion = 1444\n\nNow, substitute the value of Lion into the equation for Tiger:\nTiger = 2372 + 1444\nTiger = 3816\n\nNow, let's find the number of Bear.\n\nBear = Tiger + Lion + Wolf\nWe know that Tiger = 3816, Lion = 1444, and Wolf = 212 + Moose. We also know that Moose = 1387 + Lion, so:\nWolf = 212 + (1387 + Lion)\nWolf = 1599 + Lion\n\nSubstitute the values of Tiger, Lion, and Wolf into the equation for Bear:\nBear = 3816 + 1444 + (1599 + Lion)\nBear = 6860 + Lion\n\nNow, substitute the value of Lion into the equation for Bear:\nBear = 6860 + 1444\nBear = 8304\n\nNow, let's find the number of Raccoon.\n\nRaccoon = 259 + Bear\nWe know that Bear = 8304, so:\nRaccoon = 259 + 8304\nRaccoon = 8563\n\nNow, let's find the number of Deer.\n\nDeer = 294 + Raccoon + Tiger\nWe know that Raccoon = 8563 and Tiger = 3816, so:\nDeer = 294 + 8563 + 3816\nDeer = 13673\n\nNow, let's find the number of Kangaroo.\n\nKangaroo = 20 + Deer\nWe know that Deer = 13673, so:\nKangaroo = 20 + 13673\nKangaroo = 13693\n\nFinally, let's find the number of Fox.\n\nFox = Kangaroo\nWe know that Kangaroo = 13693, so:\nFox = 13693\n\nThe final answer is 13693."

The number of Lion equals 818 plus the number of Fox.\n   So, the number of Lion = 818 + 106 = 924.\n   And the number of Elephant = 924.\n4. The number of Horse equals 119 plus the number of Elephant.\n   So, the number of Horse = 119 + 924 = 1043.\n5. The number of Bear equals 62 plus the number of Horse.\n   So, the number of Bear = 62 + 1043 = 1105.\n6.

            "To find the number of Penguin, we need to follow the given equations step by step.\n\n1. The number of Owl equals 731 plus the number of Dove.\n2. The number of Penguin equals 319 plus the number of Owl.\n\nWe can start by finding the number of Dove, which is equal to the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Sparrow.\n\n3. The number of Dove equals the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Sparrow.\n\nWe can find the number of Sparrow by adding the number of Cardinal to 382.\n\n4. The number of Sparrow equals 382 plus the number of Cardinal.\n\nThe number of Cardinal is given as 182.\n\n5. The number of Cardinal equals 182.\n\nSo, the number of Sparrow is 382 + 182 = 564.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Dove by adding the number of Parrot and the number of Sparrow.\n\n6. The number of Dove equals the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Sparrow.\n\nThe number of Parrot is 935 plus the sum of the number of Falcon and the number of Blue Jay.\n\n7. The number of Parrot equals 935 plus the sum of the number of Falcon and the number of Blue Jay.\n\nWe can find the number of Blue Jay by adding 229 to the sum of the number of Peacock, the number of Cardinal, and the number of Sparrow.\n\n8. The number of Blue Jay equals 229 plus the sum of the number of Peacock, the number of Cardinal, and the number of Sparrow.\n\nThe number of Peacock is 25 plus the number of Sparrow.\n\n9. The number of Peacock equals 25 plus the number of Sparrow.\n\nThe number of Sparrow is 564.\n\n10. The number of Sparrow equals 564.\n\nSo, the number of Peacock is 25 + 564 = 589.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Blue Jay by adding 229 to the sum of the number of Peacock, the number of Cardinal, and the number of Sparrow.\n\n11. The number of Blue Jay equals 229 plus the sum of the number of Peacock, the number of Cardinal, and the number of Sparrow.\n\nThe number of Cardinal is 182.\n\n12. The number of Cardinal equals 182.\n\nThe number of Sparrow is 564.\n\n13. The number of Sparrow equals 564.\n\nSo, the number of Blue Jay is 229 + 589 + 182 + 564 = 1564.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Falcon by subtracting the number of Blue Jay from the number of Hawk.\n\n14. The number of Falcon equals 486 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Blue Jay.\n\nThe number of Hawk is 37 plus the number of Blue Jay.\n\n15. The number of Hawk equals 37 plus the number of Blue Jay.\n\nThe number of Blue Jay is 1564.\n\n16. The number of Blue Jay equals 1564.\n\nSo, the number of Hawk is 37 + 1564 = 1601.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Falcon by adding 486 to the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Blue Jay.\n\n17. The number of Falcon equals 486 plus the sum of the number of Hawk and the number of Blue Jay.\n\nThe number of Blue Jay is 1564.\n\n18. The number of Blue Jay equals 1564.\n\nThe number of Hawk is 1601.\n\n19. The number of Hawk equals 1601.\n\nSo, the number of Falcon is 486 + 1601 + 1564 = 3651.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Parrot by adding 935 to the sum of the number of Falcon and the number of Blue Jay.\n\n20. The number of Parrot equals 935 plus the sum of the number of Falcon and the number of Blue Jay.\n\nThe number of Falcon is 3651.\n\n21. The number of Falcon equals 3651.\n\nThe number of Blue Jay is 1564.\n\n22. The number of Blue Jay equals 1564.\n\nSo, the number of Parrot is 935 + 3651 + 1564 = 7140.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Dove by adding the number of Parrot and the number of Sparrow.\n\n23. The number of Dove equals the sum of the number of Parrot and the number of Sparrow.\n\nThe number of Parrot is 7140.\n\n24. The number of Parrot equals 7140.\n\nThe number of Sparrow is 564.\n\n25. The number of Sparrow equals 564.\n\nSo, the number of Dove is 7140 + 564 = 7704.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Owl by subtracting the number of Dove from 731.\n\n26. The number of Owl equals 731 plus the number of Dove.\n\nThe number of Dove is 7704.\n\n27. The number of Dove equals 7704.\n\nSo, the number of Owl is 731 - 7704 = -6973.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Penguin by adding 319 to the number of Owl.\n\n28. The number of Penguin equals 319 plus the number of Owl.\n\nThe number of Owl is -6973.\n\n29.

The number of Dove equals the number of Eagle.\n   Then, the number of Dove = 958 + (C + S + P).\n\n4. The number of Crow equals 295 plus the number of Dove.\n   Then, the number of Crow = 295 + (958 + (C + S + P)).\n\n5. The number of Falcon equals 641 plus the number of Crow.\n   Then, the number of Falcon = 641 + (295 + (958 + (C + S + P))).\n\n6. The number of Parrot equals the sum of the number of Falcon, the number of Dove, and the number of Peacock.\n   Then, the number of Parrot = (641 + (295 + (958 + (C + S + P)))) + (958 + (C + S + P)) + P.\n\n7. The number of Hawk equals 815 plus the number of Parrot.\n   Then, the number of Hawk = 815 + ((641 + (295 + (958 + (C + S + P)))) + (958 + (C + S + P)) + P).\n\n8. The number of Cardinal equals the sum of the number of Peacock and the number of Blue Jay.\n   Then, the number of Cardinal = P + 659.\n\n9. The number of Sparrow equals the number of Blue Jay.\n   Then, the number of Sparrow = 659.\n\n10. The number of Peacock equals the number of Sparrow.\n    Then, the number of Peacock = 659.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of P into the equation for the number of Owl:\n   The number of Owl = C + S + P = C + S + 659.\n\nWe also know that the number of Cardinal equals the sum of the number of Peacock and the number of Blue Jay.\n   Then, the number of Cardinal = 659 + 659 = 1318.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of C into the equation for the number of Owl:\n   The number of Owl = C + S + P = 1318 + S + 659.\n\nWe also know that the number of Sparrow equals the number of Blue Jay.\n   Then, the number of Sparrow = 659.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of S into the equation for the number of Owl:\n   The number of Owl = C + S + P = 1318 + 659 + 659.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of the number of Owl into the equation for the number of Eagle:\n   The number of Eagle = 958 + (C + S + P) = 958 + (1318 + 659 + 659).\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of the number of Eagle into the equation for the number of Dove:\n   The number of Dove = 958 + (C + S + P) = 958 + (1318 + 659 + 659).\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of the number of Dove into the equation for the number of Crow:\n   The number of Crow = 295 + (958 + (C + S + P)) = 295 + (958 + (1318 + 659 + 659)).\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of the number of Crow into the equation for the number of Falcon:\n   The number of Falcon = 641 + (295 + (958 + (C + S + P))) = 641 + (295 + (958 + (1318 + 659 + 659))).\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of the number of Falcon into the equation for the number of Parrot:\n   The number of Parrot = (641 + (295 + (958 + (C + S + P)))) + (958 + (C + S + P)) + P = (641 + (295 + (958 + (1318 + 659 + 659)))) + (958 + (1318 + 659 + 659)) + 659.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of the number of Parrot into the equation for the number of Hawk:\n   The number of Hawk = 815 + ((641 + (295 + (958 + (C + S + P)))) + (958 + (C + S + P)) + P) = 815 + ((641 + (295 + (958 + (1318 + 659 + 659)))) + (958 + (1318 + 659 + 659)) + 659).\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation for the number of Hawk:\n   The number of Hawk = 815 + ((641 + (295 + (958 + 2634))) + (958 + 2634 + 659)) = 815 + ((641 + (295 + 3592)) + (958 + 2634 + 659)) = 815 + ((641 + 3887) + (3592 + 2634 + 659)) = 815 + (4528 + 5965) = 815 + 10493 = 11298.\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of the number of Hawk into the equation for the number of Penguin:\n   The number of Penguin = 822 + the number of Hawk = 822 + 11298.\n\nThe final answer is: 12120"

The number of Woodpecker equals 742 plus the number of Dove.\n6. The number of Blue Jay equals the sum of the number of Cardinal and the number of Swan.\n7. The number of Seagull equals the sum of the number of Owl, the number of Hawk, and the number of Dove.\n8. The number of Cardinal equals 519 plus the number of Swan.\n9. The number of Swan equals 320 plus the number of Falcon.\n10. The number of Crow equals the sum of the number of Swan, the number of Peacock, and the number of Woodpecker.\n11.

The number of Sparrow equals the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Falcon.\n15. The number of Penguin equals 120 plus the number of Parrot.\n\nLet's start by finding the number of Falcon, which is 917 plus the number of Robin. Since the number of Robin is 484, the number of Falcon is 1401.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Sparrow, which is the sum of the number of Penguin and the number of Falcon. The number of Penguin is 120 plus the number of Parrot. We don't know the number of Parrot yet, but we can come back to it later.\n\nThe number of Hawk is 841 plus the number of Sparrow. We can substitute the expression for the number of Sparrow: 841 + (120 + the number of Parrot) + 1401.\n\nSimplifying, we get 3242 + the number of Parrot.\n\nNow, let's find the number of Parrot. The number of Parrot is 470 plus the number of Blue Jay. The number of Blue Jay is the sum of the number of Cardinal and the number of Swan. The number of Cardinal is 519 plus the number of Swan.\n\nThe number of Swan is 320 plus the number of Falcon, which we found to be 1401. So, the number of Swan is 1701.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Cardinal: 519 + 1701 = 2220.\n\nThe number of Blue Jay is the sum of the number of Cardinal and the number of Swan: 2220 + 1701 = 3921.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Parrot: 470 + 3921 = 4391.\n\nNow that we have the number of Parrot, we can find the number of Penguin: 120 + 4391 = 4511.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Sparrow: 4511 + 1401 = 5912.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Hawk: 3242 + 5912 = 9154.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Dove: 9154 + 1401 + 484 = 10639.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Woodpecker: 742 + 10639 = 10881.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Owl: the number of Owl equals the number of Woodpecker, which is 10881.\n\nThe final answer is: 10881"

Crow = 392 + Peacock\n\nWe can start by finding the value of Falcon, which is equal to Swan. Since Swan is equal to Falcon, we can write:\n\nFalcon = Swan = 902 (from equation 2)\n\nNow, we can find the value of Sparrow, which is equal to Falcon minus 368:\n\nSparrow = Falcon - 368\n= 902 - 368\n= 534\n\nNow, we can find the value of Vulture, which is equal to Sparrow minus 870:\n\nVulture = Sparrow - 870\n= 534 - 870\n= -336 (this is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the equations)\n\nLet's re-evaluate the equations. From equation 13, we have:\n\nVulture = Cardinal\n\nFrom equation 6, we have:\n\nCardinal = Hawk + Woodpecker + Blue Jay + Peacock\n\nWe can substitute the value of Cardinal from equation 13 into equation 6:\n\nVulture = Hawk + Woodpecker + Blue Jay + Peacock\n\nNow, we can find the value of Hawk, which is equal to 166 plus Blue Jay:\n\nHawk = 166 + Blue Jay\n\nFrom equation 11, we have:\n\nBlue Jay = 739 + Woodpecker\n\nWe can substitute the value of Blue Jay from equation 11 into the equation for Hawk:\n\nHawk = 166 + (739 + Woodpecker)\n= 905 + Woodpecker\n\nNow, we can find the value of Woodpecker, which is equal to Eagle:\n\nWoodpecker = Eagle\n\nFrom equation 9, we have:\n\nEagle = Crow + Peacock\n\nWe can substitute the value of Eagle from equation 10 into the equation for Woodpecker:\n\nWoodpecker = Crow + Peacock\n\nFrom equation 16, we have:\n\nCrow = 392 + Peacock\n\nWe can substitute the value of Crow from equation 16 into the equation for Woodpecker:\n\nWoodpecker = (392 + Peacock) + Peacock\n= 392 + 2Peacock\n\nNow, we can find the value of Peacock, which is equal to 902:\n\nPeacock = 902\n\nWe can substitute the value of Peacock into the equation for Woodpecker:\n\nWoodpecker = 392 + 2(902)\n= 392 + 1804\n= 2196\n\nNow, we can find the value of Blue Jay, which is equal to 739 plus Woodpecker:\n\nBlue Jay = 739 + 2196\n= 2935\n\nNow, we can find the value of Hawk, which is equal to 166 plus Blue Jay:\n\nHawk = 166 + 2935\n= 3101\n\nNow, we can find the value of Cardinal, which is equal to Hawk plus Woodpecker plus Blue Jay plus Peacock:\n\nCardinal = 3101 + 2196 + 2935 + 902\n= 8434\n\nNow, we can find the value of Vulture, which is equal to Cardinal:\n\nVulture = 8434\n\nNow, we can find the value of Sparrow, which is equal to 870 plus Vulture:\n\nSparrow = 870 + 8434\n= 9304\n\nNow, we can find the value of Falcon, which is equal to Sparrow:\n\nFalcon = 9304\n\nNow, we can find the value of Swan, which is equal to Falcon:\n\nSwan = 9304\n\nNow, we can find the value of Dove, which is equal to 14 plus Swan:\n\nDove = 14 + 9304\n= 9318\n\nTherefore, the number of Dove is 9318."

            "To find the number of Falcon, we need to follow the given equations and substitute the values step by step.\n\n1. The number of Falcon equals 631 plus the number of Penguin.\n2. The number of Penguin equals 59 plus the number of Blue Jay.\n3. The number of Blue Jay equals the number of Cardinal.\n4. The number of Cardinal equals 670 plus the number of Hawk.\n5. The number of Hawk equals 412 plus the number of Dove.\n6. The number of Dove equals 647 plus the number of Parrot.\n7. The number of Parrot equals 483 plus the number of Crow.\n8. The number of Crow equals the number of Peacock.\n9. The number of Peacock equals the sum of the number of Eagle, the number of Owl, and the number of Sparrow.\n\nLet's start substituting the values:\n\n1. The number of Falcon = 631 + (59 + the number of Blue Jay)\n2. The number of Blue Jay = the number of Cardinal\n3. The number of Cardinal = 670 + the number of Hawk\n4. The number of Hawk = 412 + the number of Dove\n5. The number of Dove = 647 + the number of Parrot\n6. The number of Parrot = 483 + the number of Crow\n7. The number of Crow = the number of Peacock\n8. The number of Peacock = the number of Eagle + the number of Owl + the number of Sparrow\n\nNow, let's substitute the values step by step:\n\n1. The number of Falcon = 631 + (59 + the number of Blue Jay)\n2. The number of Blue Jay = the number of Cardinal = 670 + the number of Hawk\n3. The number of Hawk = 412 + the number of Dove = 412 + (647 + the number of Parrot)\n4. The number of Parrot = 483 + the number of Crow = 483 + the number of Peacock\n5. The number of Peacock = the number of Eagle + the number of Owl + the number of Sparrow\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of the Owl and Sparrow:\n\n1. The number of Sparrow = 430 + the number of Owl = 430 + 303 = 733\n2. The number of Eagle = the number of Sparrow = 733\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of the Peacock:\n\n1. The number of Peacock = the number of Eagle + the number of Owl + the number of Sparrow\n= 733 + 303 + 733\n= 1769\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of the Parrot:\n\n1. The number of Parrot = 483 + the number of Crow = 483 + 1769\n= 2252\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of the Dove:\n\n1. The number of Dove = 647 + the number of Parrot = 647 + 2252\n= 2899\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of the Hawk:\n\n1. The number of Hawk = 412 + the number of Dove = 412 + 2899\n= 3311\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of the Cardinal:\n\n1. The number of Cardinal = 670 + the number of Hawk = 670 + 3311\n= 3981\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of the Blue Jay:\n\n1. The number of Blue Jay = the number of Cardinal = 3981\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of the Penguin:\n\n1. The number of Penguin = 59 + the number of Blue Jay = 59 + 3981\n= 4040\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of the Falcon:\n\n1. The number of Falcon = 631 + the number of Penguin = 631 + 4040\n= 4671\n\nTherefore, the number of Falcon is 4671."
