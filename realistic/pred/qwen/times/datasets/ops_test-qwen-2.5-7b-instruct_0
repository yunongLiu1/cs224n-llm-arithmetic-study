The number of Horse equals the number of Leopard, so \\( H = L \\).\n3. The number of Leopard equals the number of Elephant, so \\( L = E \\).\n4. The number of Bear equals 1, so \\( B = 1 \\).\n5. Therefore, \\( H = L = E = 1 \\).\n\nNext, we use the relationships involving Raccoon, Moose, and Wolf:\n\n6. The number of Raccoon equals 2 times the number of Moose, so \\( R = 2M \\).\n7. The number of Moose equals 2 times the number of Wolf, so \\( M = 2W \\).\n8.

The number of Deer equals 2 times the number of Fox, so \\( D = 2F = 2(8) = 16 \\).\n17.

From the equation \\( T = 8T \\), we can see that this equation is only consistent if \\( T = 0 \\). However, this would imply that all the numbers of animals are zero, which is not a practical solution in the context of the problem. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the consistency of the problem setup.\n\nGiven the setup, if we assume \\( T = 0 \\), then all the derived values will be zero. However, if we assume \\( T \\neq 0 \\), then the only consistent solution is \\( T = 0 \\).\n\nThus, the number of Deer is:\n\\[ D = 8T = 8 \\times 0 = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the number of Deer is \\(\\boxed{0}\\)."
